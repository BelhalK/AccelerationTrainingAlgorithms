abstract = {The stochastic approximation version of EM (SAEM) proposed by Delyon et al. (1999) is a powerful alternative to EM when the E-step is intractable. Convergence of SAEM toward a maximum of the observed likelihood is established when the unobserved data are simulated at each iteration under the conditional distribution. We show that this very restrictive assumption can be weakened. Indeed, the results of Benveniste et al. for stochastic approximation with markovian perturbations are used to establish the convergence of SAEM when it is coupled with a Markov chain Monte-Carlo procedure. This result is very useful for many practical applications. Applications to the convolution model and the change-points model are presented to illustrate the proposed method.},

abstract="We describe algorithms for estimating a given measure $\pi$ known up to a constant of proportionality, based on a large class of diffusions (extending the Langevin model) for which $\pi$ is invariant. We show that under weak conditions one can choose from this class in such a way that the diffusions converge at exponential rate to $\pi$, and one can even ensure that convergence is independent of the starting point of the algorithm. When convergence is less than exponential we show that it is often polynomial at verifiable rates. We then consider methods of discretizing the diffusion in time, and find methods which inherit the convergence rates of the continuous time process. These contrast with the behavior of the naive or Euler discretization, which can behave badly even in simple cases. Our results are described in detail in one dimension only, although extensions to higher dimensions are also briefly described.",

  abstract = {We present a new method for the numerical simulation of lattice field theory. A hybrid (molecular dynamics/Langevin) algorithm is used to guide a Monte Carlo simulation. There are no discretization errors even for large step sizes. The method is especially efficient for systems such as quantum chromodynamics which contain fermionic degrees of freedom. Detailed results are presented for four-dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics including the dynamical effects of electrons.},

    abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a popular and successful general-purpose tool for Bayesian inference. However, MCMC cannot be practically applied to large data sets because of the prohibitive cost of evaluating every likelihood term at every iteration. Here we present Fire- fly Monte Carlo (FlyMC) an auxiliary variable MCMC algorithm that only queries the likelihoods of a potentially small subset of the data at each iteration yet simulates from the exact posterior distribution, in contrast to recent proposals that are approximate even in the asymptotic limit. FlyMC is compatible with a wide variety of modern MCMC algorithms, and only requires a lower bound on the per-datum likelihood factors. In experiments, we find that FlyMC generates samples from the posterior more than an order of magnitude faster than regular MCMC, opening up MCMC methods to larger datasets than were previously considered feasible.},
