New Arrangements in Forest Education and Research.
Certificate Training in Agriculture (CTC) curriculum to be developed to support the tourist industry development as well. Environmental Science courses tenable at the Njala University College to put more emphasis on theoretical forestry in addition to the attachment programmes over the past 2 academic years. Sensitisation and public education programmes to continue over TV/Radio, particularly on provincial radios. Cine-vans to be introduced at regional levels since their impacts are relatively easier to evaluate than the radio sensitisation programmes. Socio-economic research into the full participation of communities in forest protection and plantation establishment will be essential. Research into the sustainable use of lesser-known timber tree species for national and rural development should be conducted. This could increase the number of species to be utilised thereby increasing the value of the forests. The utilization of white wood should be encouraged as far as possible to save the nearly over-depleted red wood stock which is currently overdepleted.
CHANGE FACILITATION.
Crucial factors for improvement In order to cope with the numerous challenges involved in developing the Forestry sector to year 2020, the following critical factors, amongst others, need to be sincerely addressed:.
Capacity Building and empowerment of the Forestry Division; Farmers Associations; Community organizations; Environmentally oriented NGOs and stakeholder line ministries. Community forestry development to ensure the sustainable joint management of communal forests, which form the bulk of productive forests particularly for medicines, snack foods and other non wood forest products. Encouraging the floating of indigenous and reputable logging and sawmilling companies to ensure the judicious management of the nation's meager forest resources and to also absorb or put the notorious individual powersaw operators out of business due to their relatively high production costs.
Rehabilitation of Kasewe Sawmill and the establishment of three other mobile sawmills (one sawmill per province) aimed at enhancing the production segment of the sector, in order to generate revenue for the cleaning of forest boundaries, replanting programmes, etc. Collaboration with and the involvement of all stakeholder institutions in resource protection and management in order to make management more effective. Structures such as the Landuse Committee, should be replicated nationwide in order to promote sustainable resource management in all seven agricultural regions of the country. Semi- autonomy or full autonomy of the Forestry Sector leading to the attainment of a Commission status will do justice to this sector, which is in custody of tremendous resources, but with insignificant support from government. An autonomous status could mean better remuneration for staff; realistic logistical support for operations and above all the capacity to expand in time with increasing responsibilities.
Necessary changes within and outside the Sector Policy and institutional changes addressing the crucial areas highlighted in (a- f) above should be effected to put all stakeholders in the right gear for developing the sector and other allied sectors. Stakeholder workshops highlighting the potentials of non-wood forest products (NWFP) targeting the following specific areas of investment will be held in collaboration with Sierra Leone Export Development and Investment Cooperation (SLEDIC) and appropriate institutions: · Commercial mushroom production for local consumption and possibly for export. · Commercial production of highly productive animals such as the cane rats for supplying hotels and restaurants and possibly for future export. · The potentials of the carving industry in promoting the tourist industry and in minimising wood waste from the logging industry. · The potential of the rattan furniture industry and its possible contribution to the conservation of the mahoganies currently targeted by individual power saw operators · The establishment of Funtumia africana plantations to provide raw material for the match industry and also for the tourist industry in the provision of carving materials. · The establishment of Anisophyllea laurina and other suitable pole species to supply scaffolding, ladder and fencing material for building construction.
Appropriate technological changes.
Enhancing Log Recovery In order to improve upon log recovery, the current obsolete sawmilling equipment need to be replaced by more efficient and modern machines to ensure a log recovery of 55 ­ 60 % compared to the current pre-war recovery of 45%. For logging in hilly and difficult working terrains, mobile sawmills will be recommended. This will avoid all the ills of road construction in forests located at high attitudes, thereby conserving biodiversity and the edaphic environment.
Enhancing Watering of Nursery Seedlings In the drier northern and central districts, the use of water pumps for watering nursery tree seedlings, will be introduced particularly for the many mobile nurseries that will be required for the "Herculean" tree planting programmes awaiting the sector.
4.3.3. Fertilizer application to boost up nursery productivity Forest tree seedling production had not involved the application of appropriate doses of fertilizer to boost up seedling growth, in the past. However, the large quantity of timely seedling production envisaged, could necessitate the application of fertilizer to nursery seedlings.
Wood Stove Programme Dissemination In view of the gross inefficiency of the traditional 3-stones cooking method (8% efficient), the introduction of 40% energy ­ efficient mud stoves could reduce the actual demand on firewood for purely cooking and boiling purposes. These stoves will be promoted in the drier northern and central districts. Their virtually zero production cost and their ease of production and maintenance by trainees could further enhance their dissemination and adoption process.
Plantation establishment by the " Taungya " method. Land clearing costs normally take a big chunk of plantation establishment costs but where farmers are willing to clear for the usual upland rice cultivation and allow the planting of forest tree seedlings at ploughing time, the final plantation establishment and initial maintenance costs could be reduced drastically. This opportunity will be explored as much as possible particularly on communal land.
Introduction of energy-efficient charcoal kilms. Traditional charcoal production methods encourage a lot of wastage and could be more time consuming. Efficient aluminium charcoal kilms could reduce wood waste and possibly maximise profit.
Feasibility of the Changes The feasibility of the perceived changes will generally depend on the total involvement and cooperation of all major stakeholders who should be consulted at every stage in the planning and development process. The willingness of the community heads to jointly manage communal forests with the Forestry sector is crucial to the forest expansion process. The realization of short-term and tangible benefits particularly through the development of the NWFP segment could enhance peoples' involvement and eventual participation. An upward review of fees and royalties and the general maximization of tangible benefit to forest-dependent communities, could further enhance their perception and valuation of forests which are currently undervalued.
Role of Various Stakeholders. Government should take the lead in sincerely and effectively involving all stakeholders in the process. Development projects should be needs driven before the land-owner communities could appreciate any impacts of such projects on their communities. Private sector involvement in particularly the development of NWFPs will fuel development in other segments and enhance community involvement. NGOs should continue to augment.
government efforts through advocacy, public sensitisation, logistical support and dialogue with donors and other partners in development. Civil society support as far as it influences grassroot organizations, local communities to get fully involved, is essential.
CONCLUSIONS.
The forecast of forests products and services to be utilised and the balancing of this demand with supply will be affected by data scarcity; uncertainties surrounding the end of the war; war related movement of people; war related damage to forest crop; migration trends; the need for the construction of 300,000 housing units; the speed of resettlement of traditional rulers; the speed of reconstitution of the defunct district councils; the economic performance of the country etc. The grossly marginalized and underfunded forestry sector can serve the nation better if it is autonomous enough to improve staff remuneration and welfare on the basis of productivity and enhanced job environment. Necessary increases in staff strength could make the sector more responsive to the needs of the nation. The role of tradition in conservation and the involvement of all stakeholders in the planning and execution of forest management will be crucial to both the planning and execution process. The role of women in seedling production and forest conservation should be enhanced including the recruitment of female forestry extension agents to change the face of extension agents. Donor involvement in and support to the process is crucial to the realization of set objectives.

Background Following the receipt of a letter (Reference GCP/INT/679/EC) from the FAO Representative in Nigeria (Hashin A-Ashami) by the Federal Director of Forestry, Abuja (Mr. G. O. Igugu), we (Messrs. Olaleye and Ameh) were contacted to prepare a Forest Resource Situation Assessment Report for Nigeria. To facilitate our release and speedy implementation of this assignment, necessary approvals were sought and obtained from the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Abuja. A contract for the assignment was then signed by the Federal Director of Forestry, Mr. G. O. Igugu.
Terms of References (TOR) Under the general supervision of the Director, Forest Resources Division, Forestry Department and the direct supervision of the Co-ordinator EC FAO Partnership Programme on Data Collection and Analysis for Sustainable Forestry Management in ACP Countries and in close collaboration with Forestry Officers involved in the implementation of the ECFAO Project, the incumbent will:  Collect and compile available data on forest and vegetation cover:  Provide forest and vegetation classification scheme used in the country as well as the current status of each forest/vegetation classes; and  Report on the forest volumes (growing stock, increment and harvesting intensities for each type of forest class at national level and if possible at sub-national level (regions). For this study, the incumbent will carry out a review of the existing documents and information from 1992 up-till now. Besides, it is requested that relevant source information (inventory reports, maps and) should be duplicated and made available for FAO. In support of this study, two FRA/FAO technical papers are herewith (see attachment) a) b) FRA 2000; Guidelines for assessments in tropical and sub-tropical countries; and FRA 2000; Terms and Definitions.

Limitations of the assignment.
During the course of this assignment, seven major limitations were encountered. These include:.
Limited source of documents.
Available documents on the forest Resource Situation are few and are scattered in different organisations located in different parts of the country. 1.4.2 Lack of complete and up-to-date information on forest resources.
The most current information on the Forest Resource Situation in Nigeria is provided in draft report by Beak Consultants of Canada who have just completed the inventory of the high forests and plantations in Nigeria. This implies that their reports are yet to be appraised by the Federal Government of Nigeria.
Limited coverage of the forest inventory.
The inventory exercise conducted by Beak Consultants of Canada covered only twenty-eight (28) states of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The inventory did not include eight (8) arid states of Northern Nigeria.
Comparable Recent Forest Resource Information not available.
The last inventory of the high forests in Nigeria was done about 20 years ago by the FAO and UNDP. The degree of reliability of information from the recent inventory may be difficult to assess due to many factors including modern technology.
Time constraints. Sufficient time was not available for the assignment, particularly to source for information from various locations in Nigeria.
Production delays. Production delays were encountered during the preparation of this report due to frequent and prolonged power outages in Ibadan.
FAO Input Data.
This chapter deals with all the questionnaires associated with the FAO Input Data. Relevant documents are attached where necessary. All input tables were produced using Microsoft Excel. Answers have been provided for all the sections (1 -) based on available information (see Appendix 3).
3.1. A Report on the Forest Resource Situation Assessment of Nigeria Introduction:.
Nigeria is one of the countries in the West Africa sub-region. It is located between Latitudes 40-140N and Longitude 20-140E. It has a total area of 923,768km2. The population of Nigeria is estimated to be 90 million (1991 Census). It is bounded by the Republic of Chad and Niger Republic in the north, Benin Republic in the west, the Republic of Cameroon in the east and by the Atlantic Ocean in the south.
Administrative subdivision of Nigeria. The Federal Republic of Nigeria is currently divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory called Abuja as shown in Table 1 below. The States are further sub-divided into 776 local government areas.

Ecological Zones of Nigeria The major ecological zones of Nigeria are as follows:.
Freshwater swamps Forest.
Lowland Rainforest.
Mangrove Forest.
Montane Savanna.
Sudan Savanna.
Guinea Savanna.
Jos Plateau.
Derived Savanna.
Sahel Savanna.
3.4 Vegetation Classification: The vegetation classification of Nigeria is very similar to the ecological classification shown in Figure 2 above. Vegetation classes are derived from the modification of the ecological zones by human interference.
Forest Types in Nigeria The most recent classification of forests in Nigeria was done by Beak Consultants (1998) for FORMECU. Eight major forest types are recognised in the Forest Resources Study Area, which consists of about 28 States of the country. The States excluded from the study are the eight arid states in the northern part of the country namely: Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, Gombe and Bauchi. The forest classification types are listed below: Savanna and woodland Lowland Rain Forest Freshwater Swamps Forest Mangrove Forest Montane Forest Riparian Forest Plantation (agriculture) Plantation (Forest).

Status of forests in Nigeria.
The current status of forests in Nigeria is based on the work of Beak Consultants for FORMECU titled "The Forest Resources Study (FRS) of Nigeria". Table 3 below shows the area of various forest types in the forest reserves and free areas. The total areas of these forest categories are also provided.

Forest Reserves, Free Areas and Conservation Areas.
Forest Reserves.
It is estimated that the total area of these forest reserves is 10 million ha which is about 10% of the total land area of Nigeria (World Bank 1992). It should be noted that forest reserves within the forest reserves vary according to ecological classification. Hence, forest reserves in the Savanna and Sahel regions may not necessarily have adequate timber resources like those in the lowland rain forest areas of southern Nigeria. These forest reserves are owned by the State Governments and managed the State Forestry Departments (SFDS) who have professional and technical staff including uniform guards for performing their various responsibilities. The reservation of land for forestry purposes was at its peak during colonial times. Efforts to increase the size of the reserves (forestry estate) since then have not been too successful. Hence, only about 10% of the land area of the country is currently under forest reserves. As shown in Table 3 the total area in forest reserves of the FRS Study Area is 2,740,887 ha. It should be noted that the bulk of the forestry products and services are obtained from the management of the forest reserves. Some of the major products include poles, sawnwood, veneer and fuelwood. However, these products are still obtainable from "free areas " of the country.
Free Areas.
Free areas are forested areas that are not under strict management by the SFDs. However, permission to exploit trees from free areas still have to be obtained from SDFs. As can be seen in Table 3, the total area in free forest areas in the study area is 11,780,896 ha. They provide additional sources of forest products and services. In fact, they are considered to be very.
important for private forestry development. Some of the areas have been targeted as Potential Plantation Areas (PPAs).
Conservation Areas Conservation areas in Nigeria include National Parks, Game and Wildlife sanctuaries, proposed Game Reserves/Wildlife Sanctuaries and Strict Nature Reserves (SNR). Table 4 is an updated list of conservation areas in the country. Table 4 - Updated List of Conservation Areas in Nigeria.

This list is based on the World Bank Report (Forest Sector Review) of 1992. As shown in Table 4, the total area under conservation is 3,989,871 ha. It is worth noting that there are now six National Parks (NP) in Nigeria namely: Kainji NP (534,082 ha), Old Oyo NP (251,200 ha), Cross River NP (280,000 ha), Gashaka-Gumti NP (640,248 ha) Yankari NP (224,410 ha) and Chad Basin NP (225,800 ha). The total area occupied by the six National Parks in the country is 2,155,740 ha. The National Parks Service manages all National Parks. Each of the National Parks is headed by a General Manager and supported by professional and technical staff. Apart from National Parks, other conservation areas include Game Reserves/Wildlife Sanctuaries and Strict Nature Reserves (SNRs). These categories of conservation areas are managed mainly by the wildlife sections of the SFDs. However, foreign organisations and Non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are very active in the management of SNRs. Generally, conservation areas in Nigeria are still considered to be inadequate to protect biologically diverse environments in the country. Of particular interests are the Niger-Delta area and the Hadeja-Nguru wetlands. Oil exploration activities have adversely affected the environment in the Niger Delta areas. Human activities such as bush burning and shifting cultivation are destroying the ecosystem of the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands. Hence, the area is now gradually being destroyed as habitat for migratory birds from Europe.
Land Ownership and Tenure.
The Land Use Decree No 6 of 1978 guides land ownership and tenure. By this decree, the authority to own any piece of land, including forestry land, is exclusively vested on the Governor of the State where the land is located. "The objective of this Decree was to make land easily accessible to every Nigerian for development purposes in any part of the country and to vest the control of such development in the State Government so that the use of the land would be monitored and controlled" (World Bank, 1992). The implication of this decree as far as forest reserves are concerned is that, these lands belong to the various State Governments. In addition, this implies that private investors should not have difficulties in obtaining land for forestry development.
Inventory of the High Forests and Plantations in Nigeria.
Overview.
In March 1993, the African Development Bank (ADB), Abidjan, approved a grant of UA 1.72 million for the implementation of a study tagged "The Forest Resources Study of Nigeria". The overall objective of the study is to enhance industrial forestry development in the country and to facilitate management of its remaining forest resources in all efficient and environmentally adequate way. Essentially, the study consists of three major components namely: A. Inventory of the high forest areas in the southern one quarter of the country i.e. about 20,000 km2. The following States constitute the study area concerning high forest: Lagos, Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo/Ekiti, Edo, Anambra, Delta, Rivers/Bayelsa, Imo, Akwa-Ibom, Abia, Cross River and Enugu/Ebonyi. B. Inventory of forest plantations throughout the country, except those in the arid north. Specifically, the States involved include all states inventoried for the high forest and the following States: Kwara, Niger, Kogi, Benue, Taraba, Adamawa, Plateau/Nasarawa, Kaduna, Kano and Kebbi. C. Sub-studies, which include private sector involvement and socio-economic assessment, wood-based industrial sector review, market and pricing policy assessment, review of forest legislation, survey of indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), and silvicultural investigation of selected IFTs. The following States in the arid north are not covered by the study: Sokoto/Zamfara, Katsina, Jigawa, Yobe, Bauchi/Gombe and Borno). The FRS was implemented as a consultancy assignment by Beak Consultants of Canada with the support of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). Some of the specific obligations of FGN include provision of relevant documents to facilitate the study, establishment of a study implementation unit (SIU), secondment of appropriate staff (mainly inventory officers) and financial resources to pay staff emoluments. The FRS was expected to be completed in 24 months with effect from December 1995. The results of this study is urgently needed for providing adequate and up-to-date information on the forest resource situation in the country and for defining the future role of the forestry sub-sector in the social and economic development of Nigeria. It may be recalled that the last inventory exercise in Nigeria was conducted about 20 years ago by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and the UNDP. Draft reports of the FRS are now being assessed. It is hoped that a Final Project Completion Workshop will be held by May 1999.
Inventory of the High Forests.
Prior to the inventory of the high forests and plantations, a Preliminary Information Gathering (PIG) exercise was conducted to facilitate stratification of forest types, densities and site characteristics. Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was also used to isolate specific.
forest strata. Stratified Random Sampling (SRS) was used for the high forest inventory. The only limitation imposed for this inventory approach was the requirement to distribute inventory plots across the 14 High Forest States. In other to perform the exercise efficiently, sampling units were taken as point clusters. Each cluster of size 1km by 200 m in area, was composed of two tracts (each of 200 m by 200 m) located 600 m apart at either end of the 1 km line. Within each tract, four plots of 50 m x 50 m were established at the corners to serve as recording unit for the enumeration as shown in Figure.

600 m 1000 m Source: Beak Consultants 1998, Forest Resources Study, draft of main report Vol. II, page 217. Beak Consultants (1998) noted that each cluster, therefore, consisted of 8 plots or enumerating units. Because of the difficult terrain in the Mangrove, Forested Fresh Water swamp and Riparian Forests the size of the cluster was reduced by half i.e. the size of the cluster reduced to 500m x 100m while those of the tract and plot were 100 m x 100 m and 25 m x 25m respectively. The sampling intensity used for inventory of the high Forest was estimated at 0.01% (Beak Consultants 1998).
Inventory of Forest Plantations Beak Consultants (1998) used stratified random sampling to undertake the inventory of forest plantations in the study area. The PIG exercise also facilitated the stratification of plantations according to ecological zones, species, density, soil type and age. In order to satisfy the objectives of this inventory, more plots were established within a plantation to capture variability within than to establish fewer but larger plots. Plots of 0.01 ha were therefore randomly established in selected plantations proportional to the plantation size as shown in Table 5.

Forest Resources Study, Main Report Vol. II page 2 ­ 15. According to Beak Consultants (1998), a total of 958 plots were enumerated each measuring 0.01 ha in size. A total area of 9.58 ha was enumerated thus giving a sampling intensity of approximately 0.01%.
Inventory Results (High Forest).
High Forests Tree volume estimation data were used to estimate the volume of individual trees of the high forest. Several equations were tested but most were derived from the basic one below: ln (Vn) = a + b ln (Hn) + C In (D) Where Vn = net volume Hn = net height D = Diameter (cm) at breast height (dbh, 1.3m) or above buttress. These equations were used to calculate Stand Tables, Stand Volumes, Industrial volumes, Mean annual Increment (MAI) and Annual Allowable cut (AAC).

Standing Volume.
From the FRS, Beak Consultants have developed two types of volume tables for each of the 11 high forest species groups identified from the inventory data. They include double entry (Table 8) and single entry (Table 9) volume tables. The single entry tables are diameter based only while the double entry tables relate diameter to height. It should be noted that these volume tables exclude the bark. Table 10 is the high forest gross volumes (excluding bark) by the forest designation and type.

Inventory Results (Plantations).
Inventory data from plantations in the study area were used to estimate tree volumes of plantations. The processes followed by Beak to accomplish this task include: (a) Preliminary data analysis (b) Data screening (c) Correlation analysis (d) Construction of site index curves (e) Development of site index equations (f) Modelling of volume-Age Relationship and (g) Yield projection models. It is worth noting that only six plantation species were considered for subsequent analysis. These were Gmelina arborea, Tectona grandis, Pinus spp., Eucalyptus spp., Terminalia ivorensis and Nauclea diderrichii. 21.
Stand Volume Table, Major Species.
Stand Volume Tables were developed for each of the six major plantation species. Table 13 depicts the Stand Volume Table for Gmelina arborea.

Forest Resources Management Plans and Maps.
Beak Consultants have identified three types of management units in the high forest areas of the country. These units are based on major forest types, which closely relate to the ecological zones within Nigeria. These management units are designated as follows(a) Lowland rain forest MU1 (b) Fresh water Swamp forest MU2 (c) Mangrove forest MU2 Table 18 is a list of the high forest States with their associated management unit Table 18 ­ High forest states with associated management units.

The Forest Resource Situation Assessment of Nigeria as at April 1999 has been presented above. This assessment is based on the most recent information available in the country i.e. the Reports of Beak Consultants of Canada (1998). These Reports include Main Reports, (I and II), Appendices, State Forest Management Plans and Maps (24) and six sub-studies reports. These reports are yet to be evaluated by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Therefore, some cautions need to be exercised in the use of the information until the reports are accepted by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Other documents used for this assessment are listed in the bibliography. In addition relevant data concerning the assessment have been photocopied and attached in appendix 2.

Ethiopia is largely an agrarian country with over 90% of its population living in rural areas. Of the currently estimated population of 62 million, the subsistence agricultural sector engages nearly 85% of the work force. Agriculture is the cornerstone of the economy contributing about 53% of the GDP and accounts for more than 90% of all exports. The low level of productivity of the agricultural sector, coupled with the recurrent drought has made the country poor with a per capita income of US$ 106 per annum. The annual growth rate of the GDP has been sluggish averaging about 4.9% in 1994/95 (CSA, 1995). In an agrarian society like Ethiopia, forestry can play significant role in economic development. The forestry GDP as a proportion of the whole economy and in relation to agriculture has been very low. The share of forestry in the GDP varied between 2% and 2.6% from 1971 to 1985 and declined to 1.9% between 1986 and 1987. The share of forestry in the agricultural GDP varied between 3.8% and 4.8% during 1971-1985 and declined to 3.7% in 1986 and 1987. If direct consumption of commodities such as fuel wood and charcoal and the indirect contributions of forests to watershed management and soil conservation as well as that of forest products utilised in other manufacturing and construction activities are considered in the calculation, the contribution of forestry to the total GDP and agricultural GDP will be much higher amounting to about 10% and more (EARO, 1998). Forestry's contribution to employment generation is not documented. Most forestry operations are undertaken in rural Ethiopia and a large number of labourers are required for forest nursery operations, afforestation and for the construction and maintenance of roads. This is a major source of income for the rural people. People also profit from forestry employment through firewood, charcoal collection and sales, incense and gum collection. Fuel wood production is by far the largest employment generator accounting for nearly 50% of the total forestry employment, followed by afforestation contributing for about 34%. Forest industry employment amounted to about 2.2% of the total work force in the country and contributed 2.8% to employment in the agricultural sector in 1988/1989 (EFAP,1992). The major cause of deforestation is rapid population growth, which leads to an increase in the demand for crop and grazing land, wood for fuel and construction. Lack of viable land use policy and corresponding law also aggravated the rate of deforestation. New settlements in forests are increasing from time to time and hence resulted in the conversion of forested land into agricultural and other land use systems. At present, the few remaining high forests are threatened by pressure from investors who are converting the moist evergreen montane forests into other land use systems such as coffee and tea plantations. The average volume per hectare for closed high forests is estimated to range from 30-120 m3 per hectare and 5-50 m3 per hectare for open forests. The woodland is estimated to have an average volume of 10-50 m3 per hectare. On the other hand, the annual incremental yield from all available forest is estimated at 14.4 million m3 while the demand is 47.4 million m3 for the year 1992 (EFAP, 1994). Although precise figures are not available, it is estimated that about 24 million m3 of wood is produced annually of which some 10% is used for industrial and building purposes and the remainder for fuel wood and charcoal 2.
There are a number of problems facing the forestry sub-sector. The forest resources have been declining both in size and quality. The high forests which used to cover 16% of the land area in the early 1950s were reduced to 3.6% in the early 1980s and further declined to 2.7% in the early 1990s. The information of MoA (1999) compiled for forest resources assessment 2000 indicated that forests available for wood supply are over 14 million hectares and those not available for wood supply are estimated to cover an area of over 20 million hectares. In general, underlining causes of deforestation are poverty, population growth, poor economic growth and the state of the environment. The federal and regional governments of Ethiopia recognise the economic and social values of forests and support their conservation and management for sustainable use. However, there is no comprehensive federal policy that covers either land use or forest management. Proclamation No. 94/1994 that was issued to provide for the conservation, development and utilisation of forests is currently serving as the forest policy statement of the country. Despite the fact that the proclamation has been issued six years ago, it did not help much to relieve the pressure from the forests, probably due to the absence of enforcing mechanisms. A formal forest policy is lacking and the frequent restructuring of the sub-sector has led to the discontinuation of planned activities. The Forestry sub-sector is also confronted by problems which are related to the macroeconomic situations and other factors like the reorganisation of the forestry institutional systems. Over the past decades, there have been numerous restructuring of institutions related to forestry. There were separations and re-unification of the sector with agriculture several times. The natural resources sector has been at a level of ministry, vice ministry and at present a team. Currently, the forestry sector at a federal level has a lower organisational profile in the Ministry of agriculture. Budget allocations and staff resources are often inadequate to monitor forest resources effectively and to ensure sustainable management. The trend towards decentralisation and devolution of forest management responsibilities to the local governments could not be effective due to low capacity of the sector at all levels. The current capacity of the sector is constrained especially at the regional level due to the absence of an appropriate management structure, the inadequate allocation of budget and the high level of encroachment for expanding agricultural land and illegal settlements. In order to abate the pace of deforestation and environmental degradation and establish a sustainable forest resource use and development, the Government of Ethiopia has planned to formulate a regional program on forest conservation and development. The program is expected to address the following development objectives: Increase the supply of forest products on a sustainable basis, including sawn timber, fuel wood, poles, fodder, and non-timber forest products. Increase agricultural production through reduced land degradation and increased soil fertility. Conserve forest ecosystems, including genetic and wildlife resources; and Improve the welfare of rural communities.
INTRODUCTION.
Current status of the forestry sector Ethiopia is largely an agrarian country with over 90 % of its population living in rural areas. Of the currently estimated population of 62 million, the subsistence agricultural sector engages nearly 85 % of the work force. Agriculture is the corner stone of the economy contributing about 53 % of the GDP and accounts for more than 90% of all exports. The low level of productivity of the agricultural sector, coupled with the recurrent drought has made the country poor with a per capita income of US $ 106 per annum. The annual growth rate of the GDP has been sluggish averaging about 4.9 % in 1994/95 (CSA, 1995). In an agrarian society like Ethiopia, forestry can play significant role in economic development. The forestry GDP as a proportion of the whole economy and in relation to agriculture has been very low. The share of forestry in the GDP varied between 2% and 2.6% from 1971 to 1985 and declined to 1.9 % between 1986 and 1987. The share of forestry in the agricultural GDP varied between 3.8% and 4.8% during 1971-1985 and declined to 3.7% in 1986 and 1987. If direct consumption of commodities such as fuel wood and charcoal and the indirect contributions of forests to watershed management and soil conservation as well as that of forest products utilised in other manufacturing and construction activities are considered in the calculation, the contribution of forestry to the total GDP and agricultural GDP will be much higher amounting to about 10% and more.

The woodland is estimated to have an average volume of 10-50 m3 per hectare. On the other hand, the annual incremental yield from all available forest is estimated at 14.4 million cubic meters while the demand is 47.4 million cubic meters for the year 1992 (EFAP, 1994) Although precise figures are not available, it is estimated that about 24 million m3 of wood is produced annually of which some 10 % is used for industrial and building purposes and the remainder for fuel wood and charcoal.
There are a number of problems facing the forestry sub-sector. The forest resources have been declining both in size and quality. The high forests which used to cover 16% of the land area in the early 1950s were reduced to 3.6 % in the early 1980s and further declined to 2.7 % in the early 1990s.

Objectives of the study The objectives of the study are: To collect, review and interpret existing information on the status and trends of forestry sector and the factors affecting the development of the sector To present a possible path for future development of the forestry sector through the year 2020. To survey the demographic, economic and social features and trends in the country with a view to their likely impact on the forest sector. To envisage the future direction for the development of the sector.
THE CHANGE DRIVERS.
2.1 2.1.1 External factors Population Growth.
With a current population of 62 million and growing at a rate of 2.92 % per annum and a land area of 1.1 million square kilometres is characterised by subsistence agriculture and extremely high population growth in the face of declining agricultural productivity. According to the census of 1984, the population of Ethiopia was 42.2 millions which was growing at 2.95 % per annum (CSA, 1985). By mid 1990, the population was estimated at 50.6 million of which about 89 % lived in rural areas (CSA, 1990). The population in 1994 was 53.5 million which grew to 61.7 million in 1999 of which 85% are rural and 15% are urban(CSA,1999). Based on the projection made by Anders et, al. 2000, the population is expected to increase to 102 million by year 2020. The high population growth is driven by a high fertility rate of about 6 children per year. The same report indicated that there has been a change in the annual population growth rate from 2.18 % between 1955 and 1960 which increased to 2.43 % between 1975 and 1980. The growth rate then changed to 2.45 % between 1995 and 2000. It is expected to grow to 2.49 % between 2015 and 2020. In addition, the current population density of 57 persons per square kilometre is expected to increase to 93 persons per square kilometre by the year 2020. The rural population alone is expected to reach over 84 million from the current 54 million. Similarly, the urban population is expected to increase to 34.4 million from the current population of 11.6 million. The structure reflects a high dependency ratio with about 45.4 percent of the total population under the age of 15 years and 3.2 % aged 65 and above (NMSA, 2000).
Ethiopia today has approximately 10.2 million households with about 5.2 persons per households. Urban households are smaller than rural households with a high dependency on agriculture. If all other factors remain unchanged, the remaining forest land are likely to be converted to agricultural land. The increase in both human and livestock population has led to decreased holdings of arable land. Arable land per capita declined significantly. In 1994/95, about 61 % of farming households cultivated less than one hectare of land. Only 1 % of the farmers own holdings greater than 5 hectares and these are likely to be concentrated in the sparsely populated areas with low agricultural potential. The increase both in the rural and urban population means that there will be more pressure both on forest and agricultural lands. This also means an increase in the demand for forest products. As a result, deforestation will continue and all the positive functions of forests will disappear. The increase in urbanization also calls for more wood for construction. Unless appropriate forest policy and existing environmental policy are in place and effective, these trend will continue unabated. If all other factors remain unchanged, the remaining forest land is likely to be converted to agricultural land. The forest area per capita is decreasing which will reduce the services rendered by the forests. Unless the technologies used result in increasing agricultural productivity, the pressure on forests will steadily increase. There will be a decreasing forest-population ratio in the years to come.
Economic Growth.
Ethiopia is one of the least developed countries in the world. The gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997 was USD 6,181 million at market prices and exchange rate. GDP with baseline scenario, at high growth scenario and low growth scenario is as shown in Table 1 (NMSA, 2000).

The country's economy is heavily dependent on agriculture for generating employment, income and foreign exchange. The dominant sectors and their contribution to GDP in 1994 were 49.7% for agriculture 11.2% for industry and 39.1% for services (NMSA, 2000). Ethiopia has been restructured from a unitary and highly centralized state into a federal one whereby the regional administrations are entitled to plan and execute their own development activities. The economic aspects of these policies stress the liberalization of the economy to become market-oriented. The previous centralized economic planning and decision making, which gave total authority on the economy to the state has been abolished. The decentralization and devolution process that Ethiopia has undergone in the last few years has resulted in new political and administrative institutions. The introduction of a federal system has changed the balance of power in favour of the regional states, which have the legislative, executive and judicial powers The poor performance of the economy over the last two decades demonstrated itself through declining rates of economic growth. The annual average GDP growth rate ranged from -5.2 in 1992 to 4.9 in 1993. The average growth rate in GDP from 1990 to 1997 is -.
The annual growth rate for GDP per capita is estimated at -2.6 % and the average GDP per capita is estimated at $ 106 (Anders et al, 2000). Economic growth and agricultural growth are constrained by the deteriorating forest resource base in particular and the environment in general. In addition to the degradation of forests, the most pressing environmental problems are land degradation, including soil erosion as well as the loss of soil fertility and bio-diversity. The availability of foreign exchange is one of the major requirements for an increase in GDP which is limited by the decline in productivity of the agriculture sector and a high rate of population growth. The low rate of growth in the agriculture sector is aggravated by inappropriate land use practices, which focus on extensive land use. In Ethiopia, the major export commodity is coffee, which on average accounts for 65% of the foreign currency earnings. In an attempt to increase foreign exchange earnings, the government opted to increase the area under coffee through clearing of forests in the south-western part of the country. The industrial sector is not much better than the agriculture sector. It did not show growth and less labour is absorbed by the sector. The shift of labour employment from the agriculture to the industrial sector is not substantial showing the poor performance of the economy. An estimated 50 % of the population lives below the absolute poverty line. More than 13 million people living in the rural areas are classified as food insecure who are unable to meet their subsistence requirements even in years of normal rainfall. The economically active rural population was estimated to have grown by more than 3 percent per annum between 1985 and 1995. Around 550,000 persons were added to the labour force each year. The absorption of such a large labour force into productive employment has remained one of the major challenges for the government. The central concern is the widespread poverty which is mainly determined by poor performance of the economy. Declining standard of livelihood of the farming communities and their close dependence on forests and woodlands have led to clearing for subsistence farming, cutting of trees for fuel wood and charcoal production both for consumption and sale, construction 8.
material and over-grazing. High population growth is a reflection of the incidence of poverty and is, at the same time, a key factor in the accelerating deterioration of the natural resource base particularly, forests. Environmental degradation, in turn, severely constrains production and productivity of the agricultural sector and, therefore, the growth of the overall economy. With population increasing faster than the economy, the per capita income declined, and this, in turn has adverse effect on forests. This means that the population growth in the agricultural sector is high which led to an increase in the ratio of population to land, causing overgrazing, deforestation, environmental degradation and reduction in agricultural productivity.
Development in the Agriculture Sector.
Socio-economically, agriculture at subsistence level is the mainstay of the economy and contributes 53 % of the GDP, 90% of the export earning and 85% of the employment and livelihood. Because of the importance of agriculture for the overall economy of the country, and its particular importance to the livelihoods of the bulk of the rural poor, the government has based its long term development strategy on Agriculture Development Led Industrialisation (ADLI). This strategy views agriculture as the primary stimulus to generate employment and income for the poor. The strategy relies on promoting small scale crop and livestock production, intensification and diversification of farm enterprises, strengthening rural institutions, enhancing the availability of rural credit, grass root participation and creating community awareness in development. Over the past many years the agricultural sector of Ethiopia showed a very low growth rate. Total food production ranged between 5.05 million metric tons (1985) and 10 million metric tons (1996). The overall food production showed a trend of steady increase followed by a trend of decrease (1991-1994) (FDRE, 1996). According to the Land Use Planning and Regulatory Team of the MoA, about 66 % of the land area is potentially arable. Despite the big potential, only less than 20 % or an estimated 16 million hectares is presently under crops. About 20,000 to 30,000 hectares of crop land is abandoned annually because cropping can no longer be supported on the highly degraded areas. The highlands (above 1500m above sea level) which amount to about 44% of the highland mass. are the greatest economic asset of the country. They shelter about 88 % of the total population and account for over 90% of the economic activity, including about 95% of the cultivated lands and 67% of the livestock population. Close to 60% of the highlands exhibits slopes in excess of 30%. The country has a significant potential for irrigation. An estimated 3.6 million hectares of land area is irrigable from surface water alone. Agriculture which is dominated by smallholder peasant agriculture accounts for more than 95% of the total food production. These sector is dependent on natural rainfall and traditional farming methods with a very limited use of improved technologies. The food production trend is very much correlated with the rainfall pattern. Land degradation is a constraint affecting improvements in agricultural production and 9.
hence food security for the population. Total crop production on private peasant holdings was 25% below the 1996/97 and 10% below the 1994/95 levels (CSA, 1997/98). The performance of the agricultural sector has been poor. Its annual growth rate for the past 20 years has never exceeded 2% while the population growth rate is now about 2.9 % per year. Agriculture registered negative growth rates in 1991/92 (-2.7%), 1993/94 (-3.6%), and 1997/98 (-11.4%) while during the same period population grew at an annual rate of 3 % (DPPC, 2000). According to the current estimate of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 52% of the total population is thought to be food insecure or below the poverty line (FDRE, 1996). The Government of Ethiopia has drafted a food security strategy for the country in November 1996 to increase food production through the diffusion of simple technology packages within small holder institution in areas of reliable rainfall. The extension package includes improved seeds, fertilizers and better crop husbandry methods. Livestock development is also a high priority of the Government through the intensification of small holder dairy farming. Intensification of agricultural production through the use of fertilizer, improved seeds and chemicals can have a favourable impact on labour absorption. In the future, the availability of agricultural land per capita is likely to decrease which will result a continued and increased pressure on rural resources including the remaining forests and woodlands unless improvement in agricultural productivity is made through intensification of agricultural lands. The anticipated growth in agriculture would come from opening up new lands for cultivation through expanded irrigation in low lying areas. Other strategies also include marketing infrastructure, promotion of irrigation etc. which all aim at increasing agricultural production.
Change in Energy Use and Their Implications on Forest Resources.
The energy sector remains heavily dependent on wood for fuel. Despite the poor documentation on the production and consumption of wood fuel (EFAP, 1994) estimated that wood provided 78% while dung and crop residues providing 16% of the energy required. However, national figures conceal considerable regional and local variation in both supply and consumption patterns. This could be due to the varying fuel wood prices and costs of supplying alternative energy sources which also have large influence on the consumption pattern and the level of biomass consumption. Even though per capita energy consumption is among the lowest in the world, the gap between sustainable fuelwood supply and demand is constantly widening. The current fuelwood deficit is estimated to be about 47 million m3. The demand of households for forest products in many areas exceeds by far the annual incremental yield from the existing forest resources. The importance of woody biomass energy in the rural sector is unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable future, since it will be difficult to provide supplies of modern energy to most of the rural areas. The fuel wood demand and supply projection made by EFAP (1994) indicates that the current demand for fuel wood is 58 million m3 whereas the supply is 11 million m3. The same projection 10.
for fuel wood for the year 2008 indicated a supply of 9.8 million cubic meters against a demand of 74.9 million cubic meters showing a deficit of 65 million m3 of wood. The projection made for the year 2020 indicated that the demand will reach to 100 million m3 against a supply projection of 7.7 million m3 envisaging a deficit of 92.3 million m3. The major user of energy is the household, accounting for 89% of the overall energy consumption of the country. The consumption in energy is directly correlated with the size of population and with the availability of bio-mass. There is a considerable variation in the consumption of modern energy which is a function of the degree of urbanization. In Ethiopia, energy expenditure constitutes a significant portion of the total expenditure of households. The estimated energy consumption is 2.1 kg of wood fuel equivalent per person per day. Statistics show that both rural and urban demand for wood energy has increased and is expected to increase due to the growing populations and macro-economic changes. Use of fuel wood has increased as an indirect result of the removal of all subsidies since all alternative sources of energy are based on subsidized prices which reversed the progress made in reducing pressures on the natural forests. Today many people have been forced to revert to wood energy for their domestic needs. The recent tariff increase for electricity have a dramatic effects on the natural resources base where by many consumers of electricity have switched back from the use of electricity to biomass fuels to meet the cooking requirements, thereby contributing to the diminishing forest cover. The shortfall between available supply and actual demand of wood fuel is usually met through the use of dung and agricultural residues, but at the cost of agricultural productivity. The subsequent use of these substitute fuels competes with their use as organic fertilizer, and consequently exerts pressure on the agricultural sector where sustainable agricultural production could be threatened. Besides the long term measures to enhance the supply of fuel wood, the pressure on traditional energy supplies can only be alleviated in the near and medium term by measures that promote the end-use energy efficiency, increase the supply of woody biomass resources through the involvement of the individual farmers in planting trees in farm forestry.
Industrial Development and its Implications on Forestry.
One of the major reasons for underemployment of labour in rural Ethiopia is the lack of employment opportunities in the non-agricultural sectors. Even though employment in the manufacturing sectors seems to be growing, industrial employment absorbs only a small fraction of the available labour force. The shift of employment from the agricultural to the industrial sector was not substantial which shows the poor performance of the economy. The population growth in the agricultural sector was high. This was not offset by a commensurate growth in the industrial sector. This led to an increase in the ratio of population to land, causing overgrazing, deforestation and reduction in agricultural productivity. The manufacturing industry is small accounting for some 5 % of GDP and contributing only about fifteen % of export earnings in 1990/93. About 75 % of the value added income from industry came from medium and large scale state owned enterprises, with the remainder contributed by small scale private enterprises (CSE, 1997). 11.
The industry sector strategy has a number of objectives which are related to the forestry sector development. The strategy for industrial development is expected to have a considerable impact in alleviating poverty and reducing pressure on forest resources through various incentives such as, building infrastructure, electric power generation and road network and off-farm employment in the rural sector through the creation of labour intensive technology. Since 1992, industrial production has been peaking up and a number of new factories are being constructed both by the private and public sectors. The opportunity for employment by the industrial sector seems promising in the future.
Development of Communications Infrastructure.
Most of the statistical data/information required for forest resources planning, policy formulation, analysis and projection of future situations are either unavailable or partially available in fragmented form. Hence, there is a need to strengthen the existing data base through enhancing the data collection and processing capacity.
Developments within the forestry sector.
2.2.1 Policy and Institutional Changes Institutional Setup There have been fundamental changes in the forestry sector as a result of change from centralized to a market economy, decentralization of decision making and regionalization. As a result of these, ministries both at national and regional levels have been restructured which affected forest management Government forestry administration and management practices have been decentralized and the responsibilities to manage and administer forest resources have been devolved to the regional governments. They have little capacity to shoulder this challenging responsibilities and could not control deforestation. Institutions which are involved in natural resources conservation and development have had weak interaction and integration, which are necessary for the formulation of effective plans and strategies. Priorities, plans and strategies are formulated independently within the different sectors and are often conflicting. It is the absence of a common vision on the role of forests in rural development which inhibits the integration of different stakeholders. There is a need to conduct the valuation of forests and its impacts on key policy issues such as poverty reduction, food security and income generation. In addition, the capacity of national and local level institutions be improved and strengthened. Policy Environment The forestry policy which is at a draft stage sets out the following objectives: Satisfying the demand for forest products 12.
Protecting and conserving genetic resources in general and forest resources in particular, and Reducing soil erosion and protecting soil fertility thereby increasing agricultural production. The policy also encourages the development of forests by individuals, organizations and government and the designation of protected and productive forests. It also emphasises the security of ownership of forest products to the developers and the importance of protecting the forests both from man-made and natural causes. Ethiopia is signatory to conventions on biological diversity, climate change and combating desertification that have direct relevance to the forest resources conservation and development. It has established the Environmental Protection Authority and enacted a national environmental policy and national biodiversity conservation strategies and policies and initiated the same at the regional levels. Environmental protection and biodiversity conservation are high in the development agendas of the country. In view of the progressive efforts underway towards the sustainable use and development of the biological resources, an urgent national action has been taken by the Government which was realized through the formulation and approval of a well defined National Policy on Bio-diversity Conservation and Research. In addition, forestry operations are on the process of privatisation. The development of participatory management systems, in which local communities play an important role through joint forest management has gained acceptance. This is one of the new arrangements being tried by many stakeholders including the government through the Ministry of Agriculture. It is expected that the draft policy will be approved in due course. The expected out puts of the policy include among others: Participatory forest management practices in selected forest priority areas in cooperation with foreign agencies. Privatisation, devolution and decentralization, and recognition of indigenous peoples rights to forest management which are expected to change the roles of forest administration and management Understanding the problems of land degradation, and in view of future development perspectives of the country, the government of Ethiopia has developed related policies that encourage and attract private investors in the forestry sector. They encourage the private sector in forestry and related activities by leasing land outside the possession of farmers and give land to individual investors that contribute to the improvement of the environment and the people. The forestry sector is affected by major international developments following UNCED (1992) which directly or indirectly link conservation, management and sustainable development of forests and trees to sustainable economic development. In line with this, the Ethiopian government has undertaken various initiatives to adapt the national forestry plans, policies to the growing societal need for the development of the protective, productive, environmental and socio-economic roles and functions of forest resources.
Ethiopia has also ratified the Convention on Climate Change and is committed to develop and submit a National Communication that contains an inventory of green house gas emissions for a base year and a strategy to mitigate climate change. The ratification of the Climate Convention clearly signifies the commitment of the government to stabilize the emission of GHGs. The Government, being cognizant of both the importance of the forestry sub-sector to the national economy as well as the adverse ecological effects that emanate from the processes of deforestation, has taken a number of policy initiatives such as, Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Forestry Action Plan, National Action Plan to combat desertification, for the conservation, development and proper utilization of its forest resources. There are programs, plans and strategies that vary in form and content with the objective to ensure the sustainable use and development of forest resources. They all aim at alleviating the problem of forest resources degradation, which are subjected to various pressures such as shifting cultivation, forest fire, and exploitation for fuel wood and clearing for cash crop and farming.
Current Status of Forest Management in Ethiopia.
Forestry still suffers from lack of proper management systems for the natural and plantation forests. Cutting permits are issued despite a lack of information about standing volumes within the specific forest. The general objectives of forest management is to promote the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources to meet local and national needs through encouraging local communities, investors and NGOs to manage, protect and restore forest resources and land, for the benefits of present and future generations The main objectives of management are to protect and develop the remaining natural forests and woodlands of the country so that they make maximum contributions to soil and watershed protection and conservation of existing ecosystems. At the same time, the forests are managed so that they produce increased volumes of industrial wood, fuel wood, fodder and non-timber forest products to meet the needs of people on a sustained basis. The management objectives also include the increase in the involvement of local people and communities in forest resource management. Various attempts were made to map the vegetation of the country through the use of remote sensing techniques and estimate the area cover. External factors which contribute to the nonmaterialization of the efforts were lack of international support and weak political commitment. In addition, involvement of the private sector in forest management planning and implementation is still far from being significant. a. Management of natural forests The high forests are managed primarily for protection and conservation while commercial utilization is a secondary objective. In light of the status of the remaining natural high forests and the national overall objectives, the forestry administration at the federal level has classified 58 of the most important high forest areas totalling an estimated area of 2 million hectares as National Forest Priority Areas. Management plans for NFPAs have been under preparation since 1985. Eight such plans have been prepared, and two are being implemented. About half of the 14.
58 identified NFPAs have been delineated and mapped. Demarcation of boundaries has been partly done on some NFPAs. However, they have not been gazetted and this has contributed to the uncontrolled illegal cutting and the encroachment and clearing of forest land for crop production and grazing. Hence, present forest management fails to achieve the protection and conservation objectives of the state. Over two-third of the high forests are currently classified as heavily disturbed while the balance is classified as slightly disturbed. The estimated annual incremental yields are well below the optimum. Generally, they are under stocked and producing well below capacity. Many NFPAs include forests on steep slopes which should be retained to control soil erosion and /or preserve the natural flora and fauna and should not be exploited. Although the ratio of production to protection /conservation land under the high forest varies significantly from NFPAs to NFPAs, it was decided that 60% of the natural high forests in NFPAs should be dedicated to conservation and protection while the rest for production forests. The growing stock of the natural high forests is being depleted rapidly. Further depletion will be unavoidable as conflicts between the state's conservation objectives and the immediate needs of local people mount. In the face of the nation's need for wood products and the ultimate loss of its remaining habitats for wildlife and endemic species, the forestry administration both at federal and regional levels are trying to find a system of management that will minimize further destruction of natural forests, balancing protection objectives with production interests of the State and local communities while at the same time preserving ecosystems and genetic resources. In order to resolve these conflicts of interests over the use of high forests, the forestry administration is now trying to: Prepare and implement realistic forest management plans that involve local communities in all process of forest management Facilitate private sector development and Adopt an integrated approach to forestry sub-sector development.
b. Management of woodlands and bushlands Wood land and bush lands mainly occur in the pastoral and agro-pastoral zones and are important sources of fuel wood, and construction material for the local communities, production of charcoal for the urban markets and for the collection of non-timber forest products such as gums, incense, myrrh and honey. The woody biomass of the woodlands and bushlands is being depleted by the spread of sedentary farming, the growth of pastoralist and livestock populations. Open access is the main factor for the decline of the woody biomass in woodlands and bushlands. c. Management of plantations Plantations include industrial and peri-urban plantations established and operated by the government as well as community woodlots and catchment/ protection plantations. Peri-urban plantations are treated to supply urban centres with poles and woodfuel while community 15.
woodlots are established and managed by groups of farmers or a community for either protection or production of fuel wood. Catchment and protection plantations are designed to prevent land degradations such as, area closures, planting of steep slopes and areas of badly degraded land. Poor management, encroachment and illegal cutting have reduced the growing stock below the desirable level. These shortcomings are rooted in weakness in the organization and staffing of the forest administration at all levels, and in the lack of funds to support the maintenance of plantations since all royalties are reverted to the central treasury. The area of forest plantations established for industrial wood supply can not help to compensate for the reduction in production from natural forests mainly due to the nature of the trees planted and poor past management practices d. Status of minor forest products The Ethiopian forests provide a wide variety of non-wood products such as gum Arabic, incense, medicinal plants, bamboo, foodstuffs, honey etc., They are socially and commercially significant for the rural poor. They also provide employment opportunities since all activities from tapping to collection and packing and marketing of the natural gum demand high labour inputs. Most rural people in the lowlands use them for health and nutritional needs. Gums and incense are used to be an important export products but Ethiopia has not performed very well as a supplier because of a dwindling raw material supply. Average annual production between 1978 and 1991 was about 1,500 tons with peaks of over 4,200 tons. About 1,500 tons of gums and incense is sold annually through official trading channels of which 50% is exported. Domestic demand for incense is still great for fumigation and church rituals. The demand for incense at a national level is estimated at 6,000 quintals per annum. The supply was estimated at 15% of this (MoA, 1998). There is also an ancient tradition for bee keeping with an estimated amount of 4-10 million traditional beehives and some 10,000 modern box hives are believed to exist in the country. Each traditional beehive is estimated to yield about 8kg of honey annually. This translates to 3280 million kg of honey per year. The honey is almost exclusively used for local consumption while a considerable proportion of the wax is exported. Traditionally, the most important roles played by NWFPs are health care, food security and nutrition. They also support agricultural and livestock production, construction materials, household items and cultural values. They range from products used for local consumption to products which are traded in the international markets. The majority are used for subsistence and in support of small scale household based enterprises which provide income and employment for rural people. The potential economic value of medicinal plants is not yet recognized. The indigenous population has been using these plants extensively. There is no inventory information for NWFPs to estimate the potential and plan its development. The biological, silvicultural and technical methods applicable to their management and utilization have not been developed and needs urgent attention. Every management program for these resources must address these constraints effectively. 16.
Information on the management of natural stands of these crops is not readily available particularly information on the growth and factors influencing natural regeneration. The future program in NWFPs need to focus on: Commercialisation of some of the selected NWFPs through private sector involvement Investment in research and development to improve the management of these resources Large scale development of industries which use these resources as raw materials Improve the marketing conditions for these products Inventory of the resources Avoid the unsustainable and wasteful harvesting of these resources and estimate their monetary value to the national economy e. Management of bio-diversity resources Ethiopia is an important centre of biodiversity and endemism on the African continent which is related to its eco-geography-physical diversity. The centres of endemism and bio-diversity are found principally in the highlands and the Ogaden and it is worth to note that over 80% of the land above 3000 m in Africa occurs in Ethiopia. The Simien and Bale mountains have been identified as areas of plant endemism of continental importance and provide the best examples of high altitude vegetation in Ethiopia. High endemic areas that require attention for conservation include the Ogaden-Somali region, the Afro-alpine and sub-afro-alpine regions and the wet evergreen forests of the South-western part of the country. The size of the flora is estimated to be more than 7,000 species of higher plants of which 12 % is probably endemic (CSE, 1997). Though it is believed that the country has one of the largest floras, rich both in species diversity and endemics, information on species abundance and diversity is lacking. The diversity is not yet properly conserved and sustainably used. They are faced with a serious threat of genetic erosion and irreplaceable loss. The threat on forest coffee ecosystems which is found only in Ethiopia due to human impact, particularly investment could be the best example. Some of the major factors that contribute to the acceleration of decline of the resources are the absence of land use policy and forest policy to ensure the conservation and development of genetic resources, impact of other policies that invite over-exploitation of species and natural habitats, inadequate technical knowledge for conservation of bio-diversity, lack of appropriate institutional set up and linkage that assists to coordinate efforts in the area of bio-diversity conservation and development, frequent organizational restructuring of institutions and lack of national coordination and conflicting sectoral interests, as well as size and the pattern of distribution of human and animal population. f. Management of wildlife resources The Ethiopian wildlife conservation organization in its efforts to save the wildlife resources of the country has established 38 protected areas under four categories (EWCO, 1990). 17.
There are nine National parks, three wildlife sanctuaries, eight wildlife reserves and eighteen controlled hunting areas in the country with different levels of degree of management. Only two of the national parks are legally gazetted. The total area of all protected areas is about 192,000 km2. The distribution and extent of the wildlife conservation areas was very much determined by the occurrence and abundance of wildlife and hence, most of these areas are located in the lowlands while few are in alpine highlands. The highland montane forests are under represented and the broad leaved forests of the southwest are left out completely. The inventory of the species in the country indicates that there are 277 species of terrestrial mammals, 862 species of birds, 201 species of reptiles, 63 species of amphibians, 150 species of fish and over 7,000 species of plants. Among these, 11% of mammals, 3.3% species of birds, 4.5% species of reptiles, 38% species of amphibians, and 12% of vascular plants are endemic (EFAP,1994). Despite all these potentials, little has been achieved compared to other African countries. The revenue collected in the past ten years (1980-1990) is only about 188,591 US Dollars and from that of sport hunting is 856,182 US Dollars (EWCO, 1994). There was no institution established to conserve and manage the wildlife resources of the country until 1964. Since 1908, 13 different wildlife laws and regulations were declared on different wildlife issues of which 6 are still working. The country is committed to implement and work as a partner institution with respect to CITES, African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Water Birds Agreement, World Heritage Convention, Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals and Convention on Biological Diversity. A number of factors have contributed to the decline of wild life management in Ethiopia. The key problems facing conservation efforts in protected areas are land use conflicts, lack of clear policies for the conservation and development of the sector. The crucial problem remains to be the problem of implementing conservation objectives against the interests of the local communities. The involvement of the local people in the planning process for the conservation and development was ignored. The people were not benefited from this sector and started to develop negative attitudes towards wildlife resources. This was confirmed in 1993 where most of the infrastructure of national parks was destroyed, properties looted and wildlife animals killed. The violation against protected areas regulations come through a variety of activities such as deforestation, permanent settlement, overgrazing, agriculture and other activities inside the protected areas. These problems resulted in the decline and disappearance of species and loss of habitat. The consequences are: Loss of bio-diversity such as the extinction of Grevy`s Zebra from Awash National Park Hybridisation of domestic dog with the critically endangered and endemic species, Simien Fox (Canis simensis) Transfer of disease from domestic stocks to the wild animals such as Rabies and anthrax out break 18.
Uncontrolled fire which leads to shrubs encroachment and thus loss of wildlife habitat. etc. 1.2.3 Changes in Forest Technology.
Although useful results have been generated from forestry research, the major problems facing the forestry sub-sector remained unresolved. The main reasons often cited include narrow scope, few published results, weak link with stakeholders, fragmentation of the research among different institutions often with very little or no communication, poor and variable funding, critical shortage of skilled human and physical resources, poor research data base, poor or no extension linkages, etc. This is exacerbated by the absence of forestry research policy, tradition of strategic planning and mechanisms of priority setting of research programs, projects and activities. Cognizant of the importance of research and the various problems encountered in the agricultural research system (including forestry research), and the need to modernize and make agricultural research efficient and effective, the Ethiopian government has taken a commendable action by publishing a proclamation to provide for the establishment of the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization (EARO) in 1997. The proclamation brought crops, livestock, soil and water as well as Dryland Agricultural research under the same umbrella of EARO. Following this re-structuring, the National Forestry Research Strategic Plan has been developed with the active participation of key stakeholders. To translate the strategic plan into action, prioritisation of the research agenda has also been made in which major stakeholders took an active part. After careful consideration of the scope of and opportunities in forestry research in the country, seven national research programs have been identified, namely plantation forests, farm forestry, dryland forestry, natural forests, bio-mass based and alternative energy, non-timber forest products as well as timber and panel products. The general objective of plantation forests research program is to generate technologies that enhance sustainable plantation development and management to alleviate wood shortage, rehabilitate degraded lands, and provide other social, economic and ecological benefits. The farm forestry research program aims at developing biologically, economically and ecologically viable technologies that increase productivity, sustainability and economic diversity of rural land and alleviate rural poverty. The general objective of dryland forestry research program is to generate knowledge and technologies that can assist in the development, sustainable utilization and conservation of trees /shrubs and woodland resources of the drylands as well as combating land degradation and desertification. Research will be undertaken on identification of bio-mass materials for energy production, developing appropriate techniques for energy generation, conservation and efficient utilization. The bio-mass based energy research program aims to develop technologies that can help to generate energy from forest and non-forest biological products. The production and dissemination of knowledge and appropriate technologies for the development and sustainable 19.
utilization and conservation of trees on farm will be better promoted. In addition, appropriate technologies that can help to rehabilitate degraded lands will be developed. The natural forest research program will create a favourable opportunity to explore and characterize natural forests and their components so as to generate technologies that will allow their development and sustainable utilization. Knowledge and appropriate technologies that will help to reduce environmental degradation will be generated. Environment considerations are expected to become more important and technologies which are environmentally friendly are expected to emerge. Bio-mass based and alternative energy research programme aims at screening short rotation and high yielding species with high calorific value for energy use. In addition, technology for generating energy from agricultural and industrial residues and technology that can improve the efficiency of energy use will be available. The use of recovered paper is also expected to increase. Improved wood utilization technologies such as the efficiency of wood stoves, the use of wastes from timber and agricultural residues as raw material for manufacturing of panel products is likely to get acceptance and be widely distributed. Access to information is poor and research work tends to be fragmented and narrowly focused. There has been limited success in extending technologies generated from forestry research to end-users. No formal system exists that links forestry researchers with end-users which has been a constraint not only to forestry but also other sub-sectors of agriculture. As a result, extending research outputs to end-users and receiving feedback from them have been very difficult so far, which indicates the need for establishing a proper linkage. Technology generation has been confined to the fast growing exotic tree species with little attention to the indigenous tree species. The natural forests in Ethiopia benefited little from technology driven productivity gains. They have not been managed for sustainable production of timber. Most of the plantations in the country are managed by conventional methods and trees are grown mostly from seeds of poor quality. High yielding plantations as a means to offset pressure on natural forests have not been established due to lack of appropriate technologies. On the other hand, technologies to rehabilitate natural forests are in practice. Improvement in agro-forestry practices is expected to benefit from technology development. The future trend will be in a better condition with the current effort in the area of networking. The use of remote sensing technologies in forest resources monitoring shall be widely used. The formation of a regional forestry research network which is established in 1999 is aiming at strengthening forestry research and its impact on development in East Africa. In the future, quality in forestry research shall be improved and linkage shall be created between forestry research institutions.
THE FORESTRY SECTOR IN 2020.
This part of the study provides an outlook for forest resources in Ethiopia, and the likely demands that will be placed on forests in the future. It also provides a foundation for subsequent analysis related to future policy choices that could be made to ensure better forestry contribution to the economic, environmental and social objectives. Scenarios are used to display possible future development in the forestry sector. 3.1 State of Natural Forests and plantations.
3.1.1 Natural Forests The major parts of the remaining natural forests are located on steep slopes at high altitude which are logged by selective cutting leaving behind the commercially less important broadleaved species. The total area of natural forest is expected to decline at a rate of 62,000 hectares per year ( FAO, 1990). The natural forest quality, species composition and the stocking density of the natural forests will be reduced to less than 150 timber quality tree (Tesfaye et al, 1997) per hectare. They are characterized by a low stocking of mature, deformed and over-aged trees. Natural regeneration is scarce due to the high impact of livestock. At present, the natural forest and other woody vegetation area available for wood supply is estimated at 14 million hectares and the remaining 20 million hectares do not supply wood (FRA, 2000). As long as the constraints impeding management under the natural forests are not effectively addressed, the volume harvested will exceed incremental yields causing future incremental yield to fall. This will result from the continued encroachment of local communities in the high forest areas. The projected industrial wood, construction wood and fuel wood supply is expected to decline. According to FAO (1999), the total area of natural forests in 1990 was estimated at 13.9 million hectares and later reduced to 13.6 million hectares in 1995 with an annual rate of depletion of 62,000 hectares. This is due to conversion of the forest land to other land uses and due to the degradation of forests to wooded land. Within this overall change framework , it is also expected that there will be changes in the area of forests available for supplying commercial timber. The area of disturbed natural forest is expected to increase as some of the currently undisturbed areas are harvested and those, which are not accessible are opened up by new roads. If the trends continues with no change, the forest area will be reduced to less than 7 million hectares by 2020. This means that the area available for timber production will be reduced. It is expected that past deforestation rates will continue and that about 1.2 million hectares of forests and other secondary forests will be converted to other land uses mainly arable land and perennial crops by 2020. Most of these conversions will take place in the South and Southwestern part of the country. Natural forests are likely to continue to be converted to other land uses and protection of these areas will become increasingly difficult. Despite the emphasis by the National policy to conserve forests for bio-diversity and to promote the environmental and biodiversity functions of forests.
The forest area per capita is expected to be 0.1 ha. in the year 2025 from 0.25 ha in 1995 and 0.4 in 1980. Forest area as a percent of total land area was 13.58% in 1995 and is expected to decline to 11.85% in the year 2025 (Anders et al, 2000).
3.1.2 Plantation Forests The current total area estimate of plantations is 255,214 hectares, which comprise around 76,050 ha of industrial plantation and 179,164 ha of plantations for the production of fuel wood and poles (FRA, 2000). Of this, 79,500 ha represent plantations established by farmers and communities and 99,664 ha represent public sector plantations for fuel wood and pole production. Eucalyptus and Cupressus are the main species in industrial plantations (58 % and 29%, respectively), followed by Juniperus procera (4%), Pinus (2%) and other species (7%). As a response to the decline of the natural forest area, a plantation programme has been initiated on large scale to rehabilitate formerly forested areas, for construction and fuel wood production. Plantations are mainly of exotic tree species with few indigenous trees in few of the NFPAs. Eucalyptus comprises the largest area of hardwood plantations mainly for construction and fuelwood. The emphasis is on short rotation plantations and little in growing valuable indigenous trees due to slow growth rate and low economic return. The current rate of plantation forest development is not encouraging and their management is also poor. They are fragmented and mixed with many tree species with little or no commercial value. The average area of planting is about 12,000 hectares per year which is far below the required area for ensuring a sustainable supply of forest products (FAO, 1990). They are not expected to provide the multiple uses and services which use to be available from the natural forests. The supply of industrial wood from the plantations would be of poor quality due to the current low management practices. Assuming that the establishment continues at this rate throughout the period to 2020, the area of industrial forest plantations is expected to increase to about 500,000 hectares in 2020. Most of this increase is likely to be in fast growing and short rotation plantations. Projections of the future contribution of the forest plantation to industrial wood supply have been made by EFAP (1994). The projection indicated that the incremental yields would reach 1.1 million m3. Gains in productivity of forest plantations through improved management and tree improvement program are expected to materialize until 2020. The projected sustainable fuel wood supply from all forest types is 8.8 million m3 without any intervention but the projected supply would reach 21.8 million with intervention scenario by 2014 (EFAP, 1994).
3.1.3 Trees outside forests Trees outside forests are important sources of wood and other benefits. Such trees include roadside scattered trees, trees planted in and around fields, trees around homestead and windbreaks around agricultural fields, etc. There is no reliable data on tree resources outside forests. 22.
The wood supply from non-forest areas is mainly derived from two major sources namely, farm forestry and the woody vegetation patches. The stock per hectare in tons varies from 1 ton per hectare to up to 60 tons per hectare in the south western part of the country (WBISPP, 1995). The wood supply from trees outside forests is mainly fuelwood for the rural population, and wood for fencing and construction. The supply of fuel wood from farm homesteads is estimated at 80,000 tons per year based on an estimate of five mature trees per rural household. There are nearly 10.2 million rural households in the country with 51 million trees with an estimated yield of 15 cubic meters per hectare per year. Trees outside forests have the potential to contribute as sources of wood especially for construction and fuel. The future policy should support the individual efforts made in the establishment of trees around farm lands and households. Trees outside forests will be increasingly recognized as important sources of wood.
3.1.4 Development of Non-wood Forest Products In the future rural use of non-wood forest products will increase and attention will be given to the possibilities of expanding small scale industries and promote the potential use of these resources in selected areas in the country. Non-wood forest products are expected to receive attention in trade mainly bamboo and resins. The most important non-wood forest products are natural gum and incense. They are capable of supporting the rural communities in income generation. The management of these resources is expected to improve in the near future. Possible improvements in the use of the resources for medicinal use may be made through research. Policy to protect the traditional and indigenous knowledge of the local people with regard to medicinal values of trees and shrubs will be given considerable attention. The collection, processing and marketing of non-wood forest products shall be promoted to provide income to rural populations which is locally important. Information shall be generated for production techniques, marketing and harvesting of nontimber forest products. Appropriate technology for production, processing and utilization are expected to develop through research.
Outlook for the conservation and management of bio-diversity and protected areas.
The future prospect of wildlife conservation, management and thus sustainable utilization lies on the critical realization and materialization of the drafted land use and wildlife resources policies and legislation. On condition that both the land use and wildlife policies are in place, all the protected areas will have a legal status and better developed to provide investment opportunities which will lead to the improved management situation of the parks and conservation areas. 23.
New approaches to wild life management through benefit sharing mechanism with the local people have been part of the current management proposal. The benefit includes, the provision of veterinary services, schools and medical centres. This has helped to bring change to the local people's attitude towards conservation. There is a proposal to share the revenue obtained from non-consumptive and consumptive utilization of wildlife in protected areas. Employment of local communities in protected areas has been attractive and has helped to lessen the conflict due to the linkage which is created between the local people and the protected area management. The new investment policy encourages private investors to involve in the wildlife sectors which increased the demand to establish ranches, wildlife farm (Ostrich and Civet Farms) and tourism facility development including building of tourist lodges national parks and other protected areas. Establishment of a biosphere reserve is being promoted to provide direct benefits to the people so that they support and encourage the very existence of the conservation area in the long term. In addition, the integration of conservation and development program is in place which considers the impact of human population and secure the survival and well being of the people and the resources on which they depend.
Future Services of Forests.
The EHRS has estimated that in the Ethiopian Highlands over 1.5 million tones of soil are lost every year which is equivalent to 35 t/ha/year. However, rates of soil loss vary from almost zero on grassland to over 300 t/ha/year on steep slopes. The extent of erosion is massive affecting about half the area of the highlands, some 27 million hectare is significantly eroded and over 25% (14 million hectares) is seriously eroded. Over 2 million hectares of farmlands have reached a point where economic crop production could not be sustained. It was forecasted that, in addition to the 2 million hectare farm land with irreversible degradation, 7.6 million hectare will deteriorate to the same status by the year 2000. Only 20% of the area (10 million hectare) can be said to be free from serious erosion risks. This alarming situation can be eased through protection of existing vegetation and more importantly through intervention by way of afforestation. Change in land use often results in changes in the quantity of bio-mass on the land and produce a net exchange of green house gases. Since bio-mass is about 45% carbon by weight, forest clearing leads to release of carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and oxides of nitrogen. Forest conversion into pasture or cropland results in release of soil carbon through oxidation of organic matter contained in the soil. Forest protection conserve carbon both in the vegetation and soil. Currently, a variety of schemes are being developed to mitigate the effects of climate change. In line with this, inventory of greenhouse gases and different mitigation options have been developed for the country.
Due to the increasing demand by human population for more land for agriculture and wood products mainly fuelwood, it is likely to have a major effect on land availability for projects related to carbon storage. The country has established strategies and priorities within the framework of sustainable development plans and policies to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought. The regional governments are also on a process of developing their specific programme taking into account the national programme as a framework. Ethiopia has made a significant progress in many areas in implementing the convention resulting in substantial achievements. The major achievement is the finalization of the NAP itself with the participation of as many stakeholder groups as possible. The next step is to give emphasis to activities that lead to smooth transition from the formulation of national action programmes to its implementation. Thus, by designing the necessary policies and strategies, strengthening the necessary institutions at all levels and carefully designing the kinds of projects appropriate to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought, Ethiopia is expected to benefit much in the coming 15-20 years. 1.5 State of forest industries.
saw milling started in the 1920s with 46 operational sawmills in 1972 (FAO, 1990). There are now about 38 sawmills of which 24 are nationalized and are run by the ministry of Industry and sawmills and joinery enterprise. There are also 14 privately owned mills which are closed due to lack of spare parts and raw materials. Most of the mills are old and designed to convert large saw logs of indigenous species. Vertical band saws of diameter 110 - 140 cm were used for the initial breakdown with either frame or circular saw for the subsequent re-sawing into timber of 25, 40, or 50 mm thickness. The most common timber size is 50 mm thick. Recovery rate is said to average 55%. There are also five mobile sawmills which operate on the thinnings from plantations of Cupressus lusitanica and Pinus patula. There are two state owned plywood mills with an average annual output of 2,500 cubic meters which are old and were established in the mid 1960s. They have a recovery rate of 35-40%. There is also one fibre board mill with a capacity of 1,500 cubic meters per annum and two particle board mills with annual output of 4,500 cubic meters and mainly use Eucalyptus trees. There is one paper producing factory which uses imported pulp and waste paper as its raw material. Its average production has been 9,500 metric tons per annum. The existing sawmills are not equipped to handle logs from plantations. Furthermore, prospects for developing new industries will be limited on account of shortage of plantation based forest resources. The capacity of the forest industry is very small and annually decreasing, partly due to the depleting raw material base and partly to old and poorly maintained machinery with frequent breakdowns. Efficiency in processing of logs will be limited and require re-investment in the sector. Better mill recovery is not envisaged unless the sawmills are renovated. It is a common feature of the entire forest industry that reinvestment is urgently required. Without renovation of the existing equipment, the supply prediction will most probably not be achieved. Without the procurement of material inputs and spare parts, both production and quality of products will inevitably decline in the future. 25.
Demand for all forest products will increase significantly due to population growth. Large sized logs will be in short supply and shift will be made to soft wood logs. Dependency on imported industrial wood products and stagnation in sawn wood production is likely to persist due to the declining availability of large diameter logs for the existing forest based industries. Alternative raw material for forest industries, technologies that can utilize wastes from forest and non-forest products shall be investigated. Residues could be used more effectively.
Wood demand and supply situation Fuel wood.
At present more than 90% of the domestic supplies of industrial wood and firewood comes from the natural forests which are the main sources of wood products. Fuel wood accounts for the bulk of the wood used, and is the predominantly preferred domestic fuel in both rural and urban areas. The projected demand for fuel wood and building poles based on assumed per capita requirement is on the increase and is expected to be over 100 million m3 by 2020. On the other hand, the projected supply from all sources is expected to be only 9 million m3 which is far below the demand. Ethiopia is one of the lowest electricity per capita consumer and from the current trend in the prices of electricity and other commercial fuels, Ethiopia will remain highly dependent on woodfuel for the foreseeable future. The rural people will remain to be the main users of wood fuel in the future. The urban poor also continue to depend heavily on wood fuels. The urban populations have options to mix their energy use mainly depending on income level. The rural population on the other hand, collect woodfuel free and mainly depend on wood fuel as the main source of energy. Non-wood bio-mass are also important sources of fuel for the rural population. The increasing scarcity and cost of household fuels, particularly fire wood threatens the ability of the people even to maintain the already low incomes and quality of life, particularly in the rural areas. To compensate for the worsening fire wood scarcity, dung and crop residues are being diverted to household fireplaces, reducing crop yields. While there is a continued need to explore other alternative sources of energy, large scale tree planting appears to be the only realistic option for resolving the wood fuel supply problem. The rural woodlots and agroforestry on a massive scale are essential to allowing a sustainable energy supply to meet demand in the rural areas. In addition, the introduction of efficient cooking stoves for improved use of wood fuel, efficient charcoal making technology, and an appropriate woodfuel marketing and pricing practices may improve the energy problem, thereby relieving the pressure on the few remaining natural forests. With the contribution of traditional fuels to domestic energy use being so overwhelming and the supply of woody bio-mass deteriorating as a result of deforestation, the following changes are expected to take place: Dung and crop residues are replacing woody biomass in rural areas 26.
The commercialisation of woody bio-mass around urban centres is expanding and less preferred fuels are used by low income households in urban centres Kerosene is replacing woody bio-mass for cooking in urban areas More and more fuel saving measures are being adopted by urban households including buying of improved stoves. There will be a shift in household energy from firewood to charcoal. It is therefore, essential to initiate research and development of new cooking fuels and improvement of energy conversion technologies.
Industrial round wood and other wood products:.
Industrial round wood production and consumption is one of the lowest in the world. This low level of production and consumption reflects the fact that the country has limited forest resource base which has been and continue to be primarily exploited for fuel wood. Industrial round wood is mainly produced from non-conifers and there has been a decline in the production of logs from 130,000 m3 in 1980s to 6,000 in m3 in 1999 (MoA, 2000). The projected demand for construction and industrial wood which include sawlogs, plylogs, telecommunication poles and construction wood is on the increase. The projected demand for the year 2020 is 1.5 million for saw logs, 47,000 m3 for ply logs, 4.5 million m3 for construction wood and over 61,000 m3 for telecommunication poles. On the other hand, projected industrial wood supply both from the natural and man made forests is only 338,000 m3 without any intervention scenarios and could only reach 1.2 million m3 with intervention. The projected supply of construction wood will decline from the current one million m3 to 936,000 m3 in 2014. There has been a major shift in consumption from hardwood logs to logs of soft woods. This will continue to increase in the future. Most logs from natural forests are inadequate and import of soft wood timbers and production of timber from soft woods will increase. The future will depend on the contribution of forest plantations, the growth in technology and the supply of logs from trees outside forests. Sawn wood production is on the decline when one looks at the trend in production from 1979 to 1989. The average production from 1980 to 1990 has been about 23,000 m3 per year. Based on the projection made by EFAP (1994), per capita demand for sawn timber will increase in urban areas and remain constant in rural areas. The same study showed the projected incremental yields from industrial plantations to be 1.1 million m3 in 2014. The production of wood based panels is estimated at 12,000 m3 with an average import of 1,000 m3 per annum. There has been a decline in the production of veneer sheets from 1986 to 1996 which declined from 156,000 m3 to 82,000 m3. The production of paper and paper board has been in the range of 7,000 to 9,000 metric tons from the period 1993 to 1999. In addition, importation of pulp has been increasing and reached 6,528 metric tons per year. The average annual production for plywood is 3,000 cubic meters while the production of particle board is increasing from 5,000 m3 in 1993 to 7,466 m3 in 1997. The projected capacity of paper production for ten years is estimated at 10,000 metric tons. 27.
Overall assessment of the implications.
4.1 Social and economic implications Irrespective of its potential to contribute to the national economy, the performance of the sector remain negligible over the years. Mechanisms should be developed to properly account for the contribution of forestry to the national economy and the environment. The Government and the public should become increasingly aware of the fundamental role forestry can play in the national economy, its role in providing productive employment, stabilizing the environment and thereby enhancing agricultural production and productivity, and alleviating shortages in the supply of essential forest products. Forest management should take account of the diversified functions of forests. The social aspects of forestry development is better understood and has received more attention from the professionals in the field of forestry. There is a general recognition of the roles of forests in local peoples livelihoods and the importance of involving local people in developing successful forest management strategies. New management modalities have been developed to ensure the needs of the rural poor who place intense pressure on forest lands. The future management practices of forests will take into account the social implication of the distribution of benefits from forests. There is an increasing concern as how to meet the needs and respect the rights of indigenous people who are forest dependent. NGOs, both local and international are advocating different participatory forest management strategies. Access rights have been recognized for the local communities and is supported by the current draft forest policy. In the future, demand for social equity will continue and increase and new roles for the private sector to develop forests will increase. Balance between economic, social and environmental benefits will be maintained. The prospects for agro-forestry on farmers plots are promising and it is likely that perennial species will feature in the farming system. This system combines farming with tree planting without disrupting the main functions of the forest. This will help to promote the role of forestry in land use and land husbandry. The employment effects of forest based activities such as, fuelwood and charcoal production, plantation establishment and management, harvesting and the use and collection of non-wood forest products will continue to persist. This will increase the relative contribution of the forestry sector to GDP in comparison with other sectors.
Environmental values.
Out of the total 58 important forest areas, 13 of them are accessible for commercial exploitation while the remaining forests covering 60% of the total area proposed are to be managed for 28.
rehabilitation, protection and genetic conservation. Since none of these forests are gazetted, it is assumed that a substantial portion of these forests will continue to be deforested or degraded until proper protection can be afforded to them. National forest proclamations and the environmental policy of Ethiopia reflects the environmental importance of forests and local non-governmental organizations are emerging with concern about carbon sink, soil conservation, watershed protection, and overall reduction of land degradation. Despite this, forests are not protected and the environmental functions are not realized. In the management plans which have been prepared, environmental issues are addressed but no management plans have been effectively implemented. The Forest Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Project will have several projects of various kinds and is anticipated to yield the following major results: To establish a data base containing the distribution and conservation status of the forest plant genetic resources To establish Ex-situ conservation stands in representative ecological zones To increase the number of protected forest areas through the demarcation and protection of in-situ conservation sites. The future activities will focus on inventory and collection, characterization, evaluation and research and conservation activities. In the long term until year 2020, it is expected to enhance the sustainable utilization of forest plant genetic resources at national level and promote the contribution of forest plant genetic resources to the national economy.
Institutional Framework for Forestry.
Changes in national economic policies have direct impacts on the management and administration of forests. Currently, all forests are managed and administered by regions and the federal MoA is responsible for policy and strategy development. Forestry research has been organized under the Ethiopian Agricultural Research Organization and forestry training is organized under the Ministry of Education where as Forest Genetic Resources Conservation is the mandate of Institute of Bio-diversity Conservation and Research. The organization responsible for the forestry sector is known to have existed within the Ministry of Agriculture, since about the mid 1940s under various capacities, as a Section; an Agency; a Department and an Authority. Currently, the responsibility for the conservation, development, management and rational utilization of the forest resources rests within the Ministry of Agriculture. In reference to the mandate given to the regional administration, responsibilities for forest management and conservation have been transferred to the Regional Bureau of Agriculture. There are two main departments with extension and regulatory functions. The forest conservation aspect is treated by the regulatory section of the Bureau and the development aspect is addressed by the extension wing of the same. The government of Ethiopia has found it essential to undertake research in a systematic and coordinated manner. The duties of forestry research and wood utilization research centres which 29.
were used to be administered by MoA had been transferred to EURO and forestry research is organized as one of the directorates in EURO. AFREA which is the Association for Forestry Research Institutions in Eastern Africa has been established. In the future forestry research shall be strengthened so that it will have a greater impact on management and conservation of forests and tree resources. The capacity is envisaged to be strengthened. Exchange of technical forest related information will be practical and collaborative forestry research will be possible. Networking efforts have been initiated with a view towards improving the efficiency and Impact of research.
CHANGE FACILITATION.
Effective implementation of strategies and programs require a framework of supporting policies and institutions in the areas of forestry policy, administrative infrastructure, human resources development, research capabilities and peoples participation. Since management was unable in the past to control deforestation, develop and utilize the forest resources, an efficient management and planning system has to be built. Further more, policies and legislation must support the management and planning objectives and reflect the inter-sectoral linkages and harmonization with overall resource use policies.
Changes within the forestry sector Policy and institutional changes.
Establish an appropriate institutional structure for the forestry sector and a clearly defined forest policy and land use policy with the objective to ensure a sustainable allocation of land between sectors. Strategic land use planning agency at a federal level which will provide the necessary guidance on land use conflicts need to be established. The same agency will also need to be established at the regional level. The unit will need to establish a national natural resources data for making decisions on land use issues. Community based forest conservation strategies must be developed and launched in order to address the problems of forest degradation. Consolidate the implementation of collaborative forest management and social forestry and devolve responsibility for forest management to local communities. Responsibility will increasingly be decentralized and devolved to local communities with government playing more supportive roles The forest sector is weak with low hierarchical profile and staff resources for forestry which are inadequate or even not existent to monitor forestry resources and ensure sustainable management, poor enforcement of laws and regulations, and increase the significance of forestry in the economy and value the forests.
Investment 30.
Private sector forest development should be encouraged through research and extension and the provision of appropriate policy in the area of pricing, increase sense of security of land and tree tenure. The government should create an enabling environment for their participation.
5.1.3 Technology change Identify the location, demarcate the area and map the main natural forests of the country with the view to preparing management plan for their use and management Prepare a management plan for the remaining forests with the full involvement of the surrounding and included communities Establish a capability to monitor physical changes in land use, especially with respect to the area of forests. This would pave the way for more detailed forest resource inventories required for the preparation of management plans. Improve the efficiency of the existing forest industries and encourage the forest industries to be plantation based. Trees growing outside the forest such as agricultural tree crops which are important sources of fuelwood and construction material should be promoted and make this activity to be commercially attractive Development in the agriculture sector should bring change to the rate at which farm productivity grows and higher yield on land already engaged for agriculture Technologies to monitor forest cover degradation and damage should be widely applied. Improvement in remote sensing techniques and communication and information processing should be better facilitated.
Change outside the forestry sector Policies of other sectors.
Forestry development objectives will be more fully achieved and sustained at much lower cost if they are integrated in the national development objectives. There has to be a clearer overview of the interests, relationships and different perspectives of the institutions involved in resource conservation and development. The activities of the concerned sectors have to be integrated. The policies and strategies of other sectors will also need to be critically examined, especially their relations to and influence on resources conservation and development. Population Policy Implementation of the existing population policy which are relevant to the sustainable utilization of the forest resources. Education programs which address small family size, ensuring a spatially balanced population distribution patterns in order to maintain environmental security. Development of the industry sector 31.
There is a need to promote a balanced industrial development in order to secure an impact on alleviating poverty and reducing pressure on natural resources generating an alternative means of income and employment opportunity. Revenue generation In order to enable the forestry sector to play a more active role in the development of the country's forest resources, stumpage and royalties should be directly realized and should be kept in a revolving fund rather than deposited in the central treasury to enable the sector to invest in further forest resources development. Revise values on an annual basis and monitor forest products prices on a continuous basis.

INTRODUCTION.
This FOSA document has been prepared to determine the outlook of Forestry resources for the country in the year 2020. In Seychelles, the responsibility to prepare the report was given to the Forestry Section of the Ministry of Environment, being the sector with the portfolio for forestry issues. The section under the guidance of the FOSA focal point carried out various interviews and held a national consultative workshop with the participation of key stakeholders to have their views on the outlook of forestry in Seychelles. To simplify the matter prior to the workshop, a questionnaire was sent to all stakeholders involved so that they can understand before hand the concept that was to be discussed and hence get them better prepared for the discussion. This proved very fruitful in the end. The report is divided into two parts, a description of the actual state of forest resources and a forecast of the likely state of those same resources in the year 2020.
2.1 ACTUAL STATE & TRENDS OF FOREST RESOURCES COUNTRY BACKGROUND.
The Republic of Seychelles comprises a group of 115 islands located in the Western Indian Ocean between 4° and 11° South of the equator. Its land area is 45,500 ha and territorial sea (Exclusive Economic Zone) covers an area of 1,374,000 km². The capital, Victoria, situated on the island of Mahé, is located 1,150 km Northeast from the furthermost island, the atoll of Aldabra, 1,590 East km from Mombassa in Kenya and 900 km North from Madagascar. 41 islands are granitic with rugged topography. They include the so-called inner islands, of which Mahé (15,500 ha), Praslin (3,800 ha) and La Digue (1,000 ha) are the most important ones. All the granitic islands are situated within a distance of 50 km from Mahé. The rest of the islands are coralline, raising only few meters above the sea level. The population of 70,400 is concentrated on the inner islands of Mahé (60,400), Praslin (5,600) and La Digue (1,900). It is notable that the 74 coralline islands support a population of only 300 people. The average annual growth rate of the population (1988-1991) was 0.8%, which is well below the developing country average. The GNP per capita is US$ 5,100 (1991). The country is classified in the middle-income group, and consequently has limited access to concessional development financing resources. However, due to the economy's vulnerability to external shocks and its small size, Seychelles has been able to attract grants and soft loans from various international and bilateral sources. 2.2 FORESTRY SITUATION.
The forestry sector is generally perceived as marginal. The sectoral GDP contribution, including wood industries, is no more than 0.4%. However, the indirect economic and environmental benefits of the sector are considerable. The amenity provided by the forests is.
extremely important for the tourism industry. The extremely vulnerable water supply is highly dependent on the vegetation cover provided by forests. It is estimated that the forest area is 40,600 ha, i.e. 90% of the land area. About 90% of the forests are natural. Plantations, including casuarina forests, cover about 4,800 ha. More than 45% of the forests are within national parks or other conservation areas. The growing stock is estimated at 3.1 mills. m³. Due to the large conservation areas and poor accessibility, only 0.7 mills. m³ is accessible in the main islands. The respective annual allowable cut is estimated to be 13,700 m³. The demand, particularly for saw logs, is estimated to grow rapidly. The sustainable supply potential of timber to meet the growing demand will be endangered if no investments in more intensive forest management are done. The main forest management problems include housing encroachment due to land pressure, invasive exotic plant species competing with endemic and indigenous species for the habitat, and prevention and control of forest fires, which have had disastrous effects on soil and water conservation. The main utilisation problems are the difficult access to the forests, low productivity of both harvesting and processing, and consequently high extraction costs. 2.3 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.
The Forestry Section of the Division of Environment under the Ministry of Environment and transport is responsible for the controlling and management of the forest resources of the country. The Forestry Section has been mainly concentrated on production forestry and plantation establishment. The trend has now moved to forest management of conservation areas. There is a forest policy document but the Environmental Management Plan of Seychelles and the National Land Use Plan provide the main policy framework. There are several acts and ordinances regulating forestry. However, part of the legislation is outdated or has not been ever enforced. For example, not a single forest reserve has been gazetted which effectively prevents the enforcement of respective legislation. 2.4 RECOMMENDATIONS.
Based on the proposed economic and environmental objectives and respective forest sector priorities, the following strategic guidelines are proposed: · Define clear forest policy and improve and make use of legislation · Improve the planning, co-ordination and monitoring capacities of the forest administration · Promote formal education, on-the-job training and short courses on special subjects · Mobilise human resources also outside the Forestry Section · Build up revenue sources for financial sustainability · Promote tree growing outside forests · Re-orient nurseries to produce more seedlings of indigenous species · Support the crafts, saw milling and other industries using wood and non-wood raw materials · Participate actively in regional co-operation programmes.
Respective development programme is proposed to implement. The emphasis is on sustainable management and conservation of the various forest zones, and on institutional strengthening, particularly human resources development. The development programme is divided into 5 main programmes with 15 sub-programmes: · Conservation of Biodiversity Integrated Management of Biodiversity Zones Propagation of Endemic Trees and Ex-Situ Conservation · Conservation of Soil and Water Resources Integrated Management of Catchment Zones Protection of River Reserves · Production of Forest Products Management of Production Zones Management of Trees Outside Forests Saw milling Carpentry and Crafts Industries Non-wood Forest Products · Forest Protection Forest Fire Contingency Plan · Strengthening of Institutions Forest Policy and Legislation Forest Administration Human Resource Development Financing Monitoring, Information Systems, Research and Planning 2.4.1 Forestry Sector in National Development.
The granitic islands of Seychelles, which are of continental origin, are some of the oldest oceanic islands in the world. Their flora and fauna have evolved, through tens of millions of years of isolation, to have a very high level of endemism (>50%). The environmental importance of forest cover is now emphasized on conservation of biodiversity, ecosystems and scenic beauty, all of which are important ingredients of Seychelles as a tourist destination and as a globally significant site of unique species, i.e. biodiversity conservation. The growing population and the expanding tourism activity have increased the demand for water to levels where shortages are occurring and major infrastructure investments in dams are required to ensure adequate water supply. Forests play a key role in watershed management and erosion control and these activities now deserve a high priority in the country's development programmes. The economic importance of the forestry sector is generally perceived as marginal. The sectoral GDP contribution, including wood industries is no more than 0.4% (1990) but it has been increasing during the last few years. The Value Added in the sectoral gross output is significantly higher in forestry than in the economy on average. This adds to the justification of the utilization of forest resources in a sustainable way for meeting the country's internal demand. Tourism is the most important sector of the economy and accounts for nearly 17% of the GDP, 41% of foreign exchange revenues, and contributes significantly to economic growth, both directly and indirectly. It is emphasized that tourism is highly dependent on the attractive.
nature and scenic beauty of the nation, which are, to great extent, based on the forests. Consequently, one could say that, at least partly, the tourism sector is dependent on the forestry sector. Of the total supply of wood and wood products no more than a quarter is met by domestic supply while the balance is imported. The respective import bill in 1991 was SR 23.0 mill. If the imports of wooden furniture (SR 2.4 mill.) and paper and paper products (SR 20.7 mill) are considered, it appears that the sector's share of the country's total imports amounts to 5.1%. This also corresponds to the negative balance-of-payment effect, as the sector's direct contribution to exports, excluding souvenir industry, is practically zero. About three quarters (74%) of total demand of wood and wood products are absorbed by intermediate consumption, mainly in building construction and furniture, which indicates the importance of downstream effects of these products to the national economy. The demand for fuel wood appears to be rapidly dwindling due to rural electrification and expanding use of kerosene also in the rural areas. The employment effect of forestry activities is estimated at 350 person-years or about 1.5% of the working population. In addition, there are about 820 carpenters (1987 Census) and about 150-200 persons employed by various woodworking industries. Wood is also an important raw material for handicraft industries, which have important employment effects. 2.4.2 Land Use.
Land-Use Trends: The Government of Seychelles has adopted a conspicuously conservationist policy towards land use and natural resource utilization. There is also a pronounced environmental awareness among the public at large. This is incontestably a positive phenomenon in the highly sensitive environment of Seychelles where the isolation, very limited land base, difficult topographic conditions and fragile ecology set unusual constraints for the economy and the environment. Shortage of land, particularly arable land and land suitable for construction is indeed a major development constraint in Seychelles. Conservation areas (Strict Nature Reserves, Special Nature Reserves, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks, Marine National Parks) cover already 40% of the land area. This is internationally a very high figure. Consequently, it is likely that no major increase in these areas is to be expected. Forest areas, including catchment forests, are mainly under the jurisdiction of the Forestry Section (FS) of the Division of Environment (DOE). Some of these areas face encroachment pressure, particularly for housing and related road construction. On the other hand, old abandoned cinnamon, vanilla and even some coconut plantations have been converted into forest plantations, or are in the process of spontaneous reforestation, mainly by exotic tree species. Land Tenure: Private farmers own most of the agricultural lands. Forest areas, both production and catchment forests are owned both by private people and the government, who owns the greater part.
Policy Context.
Environmental Management Plan of Seychelles (EMPS) 1990-2000: The Government of Seychelles was one of the first countries in the world to adopt sustainable development as a national policy. The government prepared the Environmental Management Plan of the Seychelles (EMPS) as the blueprint of this policy. EMPS provided overall policy framework, and proposed an investment programme worth of SR 360,405,000 over the period of 1990-2000. The Forest Management sub-programme proposed three projects (SR 1,460,000) all of which were given highest priority rating: · Preservation of Endemic Tree Species · Fire Prevention Measures · Preparation and Implementation of National Forest Management Plan The present Seychelles Forest Management Plan/Sector Study is the first step towards the implementation of the third project, and it also attempts to translate the overall policy framework of EMPS in the context of forestry sector. Other sub-programmes of EMPS particularly relevant for forestry include: · Land Management · Water Management · National Parks and Wildlife Conservation · Environmental Law and Enforcement · Environmental Information, Education and Training As it approaches the new millennium, the republic of Seychelles is preparing a major new initiative to manage its environment in a sustainable manner: the Environment Management Plan of Seychelles (EMPS) 2000-2001. The country has taken the step to prepare its second environment management plan, with the assistance from the World Bank so that the protection of the environment is undertaken in a planned and coherent manner involving all stakeholders. It is one of the first countries in Africa to prepare the so-called second generation of environment management plan. The plan was to be more comprehensive than the previous EMPS. Ten thematic areas were chosen to cover all major social and economic sectors as well as certain key subjects of relevance to environmental management such as environmental economics. Other crosssectoral themes that would cut across the main thematic areas were also identified. National Land Use Plan: The National Land Use Plan (NLUP) covering the three main islands of Mahé, Praslin and La Digue, has been under preparation since 1988. The plan focuses mainly on the development areas, but it also proposes a rough zonation of the non-development areas into classes: Natural Special Reserves (strict protection) · National Parks (protection) · Marine National Parks (protection against pollution or degradation) · Potable Water Resources (strict protection) · Main Catchment Areas (occasional carefully planned development) · Forest Areas (sustainable utilisation) · Agricultural Areas (sustainable utilisation) · Mangroves and Swamps (protection).
Beaches (occasional carefully planned development).
The NLUP is considered, by MCD, to have only indicative role in land use decisions. Due to the sever shortage of suitable land for housing and other development purposes, there are often conflicts between development and conservation interests. The Plan's basic classification criterion relevant for forestry is to limit Development Areas below the altitude of 50-200 m above sea level, according to location. Consequently, all the areas above this altitude are basically designated for forestry and/or for conservation purposes. The underlying rationale is the crucial importance of water and soil conservation in the sensitive uphill areas. Conservation Policy: The White Paper on Conservation Policy in the Seychelles (1971) focused on the creation of a number of conservation areas. Several of these have since been created. Regarding implementation, the 1971 Policy proposed that a Department of Nature Conservation and Forestry be established, with the help of a Conservation Officer, whose duties would include training of Seychellois staff in conservation. That was the origin of what is now the Conservation and National Parks Section (CNPS) of DOE. The 1971 Policy gave little indication of how the various conservation areas were to be managed. No regulations have been gazetted for the terrestrial national parks, except for Curieuse (in 1991). Management practices of FS, who is, in principle, in charge of the land national parks, have emphasised plantation establishment for production or catchment protection. The FS is concerned about the decline of indigenous trees and invasion by exotics, but this has not been reflected in management practices. Forest Policy: There is no explicit Forest Policy in the country. However, DOE and FS have been following an implied policy of cautious forest utilization and afforestation of all barren areas whenever the resources allow. The policy can be said to have led to sustainable, yet not financially profitable, forestry in public forests. The Forestry Section has also certain controlling powers, in case of 23 commercial species, over the private forest and tree owners. There is an intention to expand the list, or to prepare another list, of controlled species to cover all the indigenous trees. Forest and Conservation Legislation: All environmental and forestry legislation has been reviewed by de Romilly in 1990. He recommends a comprehensive revision of legislation on forestry, which is fragmented and has a number of gaps, and on conservation areas. He drafted a Conservation and National Parks Act, but this was not considered appropriate and a consultant from FAO is now preparing a further draft.
Institutional Framework.
Division of Environment: The Division of Environment (DOE) under Ministry of Environment and Transport (MET) is the governmental authority responsible for environmental issues, including forestry. DOE is.
headed by a Director General of Environment, and is divided into five sections: Forestry Section (FS), Conservation Section (CNPS), Botanical Gardens, Environmental Assessment and Pollution control (EA&PC) and the Education and Information section. Forestry Section: The Forestry Section (FS) of DOE is the responsible forest authority in Seychelles. FS is headed by a Director of Forestry, and is divided in five geographical units. Timber Control Unit provides and controls timber-felling permissions. The three field offices are in charge of the state forests in their respective areas. Fond B'Offay covers the whole Praslin and La Digue, Grand Anse the southern and western parts of Mahé, and Sans Soucis the northern and eastern parts of Mahé, including the Morne Seychellois National Park. Their responsibilities include reforestation activities from rising of seedlings to planting and tending, local supervision of harvesting operations, some harvesting, particularly thinning, and forest protection with particular reference to forest fire prevention and control. The National Park business falls under the National Park Unit.
2.5.1 FOREST RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT Forest Resources.
Soils and Climate: The soils of the granitic islands are generally very poor and slightly acidic. This is due to the geologically very old granitic base rock, which is inherently poor in nutrients. The shallow, leached soils are typically short of organic matter. The soils of coralline islands suffer often of high salt content, and lack several nutrients and trace elements. The climate is equatorial with an average annual rainfall of 2,200 mm. The highest parts of Mahé receive the highest rainfall, around 3,000 mm. The lower elevations, and particularly the southern parts of Mahé receive considerably less, less than 2,000 mm. Praslin (1,600 mm), La Digue (2,060 mm) and all the outer islands receive still less of rain. Humidity is uniformly high at an average 80%. Mean temperature ranges from 24 to 30°C. The prevailing winds are the Northwest (December to March) and Southeast (May to October) monsoons. Most islands are outside the cyclone region. Vegetation: The inner islands of Seychelles, which are of continental origin, are some of the oldest oceanic islands in the world. Their flora and fauna have evolved, through tens of millions of years of isolation, to have a very high level of endemism. More than half the indigenous plants are endemic, including many famous rarities like coco-de-mer (Lodoicea maldivica) and jellyfish tree (Medusagyne oppositifolia). In the inner islands, particularly in Mahé, the forest ecosystems can be divided in three categories: · Lowland forests 0 - 300 m above sea level · Intermediate forests 300 - 550 m above sea level · Mountain moss 550 - 910 m above sea level Mountain moss forests are characterised by Randia-Nepenthes society. The intermediate forests were supposedly characterised by Excoecaria-Imbricaria and Deckenia-Memecylon.
societies. However, presently the intermediate forests are, to great extent, invaded by various exotic species. In the lowland forests species like bois de natte (Imbricaria sechellarum), takamaka (Calophyllum inophyllum) and badamier (Terminalia catappa) are supposed to dominate. The original lowland forests have practically vanished due to their conversion in agriculture and tree crop plantations, and due to the concentration of houses, roads, etc. in the narrow coastal belt, which was their habitat. Their species now occur mainly in the intermediate zone. Detailed description of the vegetation types of Seychelles is presented e.g. in "République des Seychelles, Ministère du Développement National, Etude des potentialités des principales îles granitiques" (1986). Yet another important ecosystem is the mangrove forests. They have been mostly destroyed from the inner islands, but are still abundant in many of the outer islands, e.g. in Aldabra. The mangroves include species like Avicennia marina, Rhizophora mucronata and Bruguiera gymnorhiza. Forest Area: No systematic forest inventories have been carried out on Seychelles and the available data are limited to a study by P.T. Henry (1976), which can be considered outdated. Based on aerial photo interpretation and field checking during this study, it is estimated that the forest area of Mahé, Praslin Curieuse, La Digue and Silhouette islands is 17,600 ha, which is 78% of their land area. 20% of the forests are within National Parks or other protected areas. The other islands of Seychelles are estimated to have additional 23,000 ha of forests of which nearly 15,000 ha are within National Parks or other protected areas. The bulk (4,400 ha) of the estimated plantation area (4,880 ha) is in "other islands". This information has been presented in several earlier studies. The amount of plantations on "other islands" may be a large over-estimate, but the situation could not have been checked, as field visits to the outer islands were not possible to be done. The above-mentioned plantation area of the "other islands" is assumed to contain largely non-planted casuarina forests. Some of them have been planted as a belt around the coconut plantations to protect the coconut palm from the wind. Their existence has not been possible to verify during the course of this study. Consequently, they may turn out to be less than previously estimated. Most of Seychelles' forests are mixed which cover more than half of the total forest area. Bush vegetation is extensive in the inner islands accounting for a quarter of their total area. These lands are marginally used even if soil protection is provided. Three quarters of deforested areas are found in Praslin mainly due to fires. Their rehabilitation is a key issue to be addressed by the Government and private landowners. 2.6 2.6.1 FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION ISSUES Natural Forest Conservation and Management.
Virtually all indigenous forest in Seychelles is mixed with introduced plant species. There are 600-700 species of introduced plants in Seychelles, but not all are capable of spreading naturally through the forest habitat and out-competing the indigenous plants. The two most serious threats appear to be cinnamon and albizia.
Another tree quick to colonize forest gaps and common in high altitude forest in Morne Seychellois National Park is guava (Psidium guajava). On Silhouette Island, an aggressive invader is agati (Adenanthera pavonina). These fast-invading, smaller species are more problematic than the albizia, because they are more widespread, more abundant and smother any possible regeneration of indigenous seedlings in forest gaps. Bois jaune (Alstonia macrophylla) is another conspicuously tall forest invader. Prune de France (Chrysobalanus icaco) also called coco plum and bracken fern (Gleichenia dichotoma) are dominant on severely degraded land, which were presumably rare before the arrival of man, so it is perhaps not surprising that they tend to be colonized by exotics. Prune de France does not seem to be able to invade either high forest or dense secondary forest. The most cost-effective approach to improve the biodiversity zones is probably to focus effort on sustained management of forest gaps, whether natural or made by clearing exotics. By tending indigenous seedlings (planted or spontaneous) and removing exotics in the gaps, a gradual reversion back towards indigenous forest may be achieved. The demand for land for settlement and associated road construction are the main forces causing encroachment into forestland. The system for handling planning applications may involve, at the discretion of the Planning Department, consultation with DOE, but gives DOE no power whatsoever to prevent, temporarily or permanently, unsuitable developments. The final decision rests with an individual civil servant, who may have no environmental training. In such a situation, the hapless civil servant is liable to be ill informed and is certain to be subjected to pressure from powerful people. 2.6.2 Soil and Water Conservation.
Fire, house building and road construction are the main causes of erosion in Seychelles. The resulting losses are substantial. Obvious losses are of land productivity and of water quality or quantity, but perhaps the biggest economic loss will result from silt reaching the sea. Silt not only discolours beaches and swimming areas, it also kills the corals, upon which the beaches and the fish depend. Due to the poor soils the process of restoring badly degraded areas will inevitably be difficult, slow and expensive. The erosion can become self-perpetuating. The bare earth surface is baked hard in the sun, preventing any infiltration of water. In such cases no vegetation will grow. In some places on Curieuse FS have dug "lock-and-spill" drains. These are said have allowed some vegetation to grow but the drains need maintenance and may be too far apart. Forestry Section has done much tree planting on eroded areas, especially in Praslin and Curieuse. Exotics have been used almost exclusively. Casuarina is the most widely used species, but an Australian acacia, eucalyptus and prune de France have also been tried. Not surprisingly, growth has usually been poor but at least some cover is established. Water availability is a crucial issue in Seychelles where the water catchments are relatively small and thus the water retention capacity limited. A study conducted in Seychelles (Murray 1992) clearly demonstrated that water infiltration rates are fastest, and soil erosion least, under conditions of dense vegetation where the soil has a high organic content and a high capacity for soaking up moisture. Conservation of the main water catchments and rivers with water intake are of utmost importance. The State Land and River Reserves Ordinance (Cap 150) stipulates that all the riverbanks be maintained untouched under permanent tree and brush.
cover. The ordinance is justified in the special situation of the country. However, it has not been properly enforced. 2.6.3 Plantation Development.
The existing plantations in the inner islands were reported to cover about 900 ha. However, in the course of the present Study, only 480 ha were found in the field. It is possible that some of the small plantations scattered in natural forests were not found. On the other hand, the 900 ha is based on the statistics on plantation establishment, in many cases calculated from the number of seedlings planted, and the figure does not take into account losses due to dying of seedlings, etc. About 25% of the plantations have been established for protection purposes leaving about 75% for production. The Forestry Section has not fully met its annual reforestation target of 100 ha established in the National Development Plan. Records are kept on reforestation and other forestry activities. However, the records are not centrally stored nor do they include any maps. The main criterion for plantation establishment has been insufficient, or lack of, forest cover, either due to forest fire or forest exploitation. Forest exploitation is usually based on selective cutting removing only trees, which have breast height diameters above a defined minimum, which vary according to three site quality classes. Therefore, tree planting after exploitation has typically been enrichment type of plantings where valuable, relatively fast-growing species are planted in openings resulting from removing of harvested trees or forest fires. Some of the plantation areas are fairly remote or otherwise with difficult access, which is a constraint for their eventual economic utilization. Availability of marginal or abandoned land for plantation forestry could be looked into. This applies also to the abandoned coconut plantations (about 6,000 ha) both in inner and outer islands. In the outer islands casuarina was planted to protect coconut plantations from wind. In the abandoned areas casuarina has spread to the inner parts of the islands. In 1992, FS planted 17,477 seedlings corresponding to a net area of about 20 ha. The main species were mahogany (73%), casuarina (21%), and Khaya nyasica (2%). The plantation work was mainly carried out by the Sans Souci Forestry Unit. The Grand Anse Forestry Unit nursery has mainly concentrated on producing and selling of ornamental plants. The rate of mahogany planting has been about 9 ha/year during the past ten years. It is estimated that mahogany plantations now cover an area of 270 ha. Other species, e.g. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, santol (Sandoricum indicum), sangdragon (Pterocarpus indica) and calice du Pape (Tabebuia pallida), have had only a minor share of the planting in the past decade. Eucalyptus has not been planted recently as its growth was found to be poor and mortality high due to inappropriate soil conditions. Albizia (Albizia paraserianthes) was planted for timber production more than two decades ago, but its planting has been discontinued due to widespread encroachment of the species. There are also three small pine (Pinus spp.) plantations established about 15 years ago. Pines have grown well. The species could not be identified. About 40 ha of Casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia) plantations have been established on the land reclamation area in Mahé since 1986. The main purpose of these plantations has been to.
stabilize the reclaimed land. This has been the main plantation work of FS during the last five years. Casuarina has been used also for soil protection in Praslin. 2.6.4 Fire Prevention and Control.
Fire can destroy in hours what it has taken decades to produce. Fire would have been extremely rare before the arrival of man, so it is not surprising that few indigenous species are adapted to withstand or take advantage of it. Instead exotics colonize the gaps. People start almost all fires, deliberately or accidentally. There is a legal requirement for fire permits during certain seasons but it is not clear how fully this is adhered to. One means of fire control is the maintenance of firebreaks. Another FS task is to control the spread of highly flammable exotics, notably bracken fern, except where they are the only colonizing vegetation in an erosion-prone area. Another element of fire control is early detection by means of fire towers. A third element is rapid response to the fire. On Praslin in the dry season, FS has half its 15 labourers on fire control stand-by during and outside working hours. It is increasingly difficult to mobilize local residents and other government staff to help fight fires. Praslin has some fire-fighting equipment, donated by Australia, but there is a need for more there and also on Curieuse and Silhouette. Fire-fighting pumps need a good water supply, which few local streams can provide. The possibility of helicopters using big buckets to dump seawater on fires should be treated with caution. The salt could kill vegetation and prevent timely re-vegetation of burnt areas, leading to chronic erosion problems. Many nutrients are released by burning; these can be quickly washed away by rainfall. FS does much reforestation work, but often this is not until the second or third rainy season after the fire, by which time many nutrients have been lost.
FOREST MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION.
Forest management should depend on the objectives of a forest area. Therefore the basis of zonation should be the management objectives of the forest. This study has attempted to make a broad zonation, using existing information and limited field observations, according to four categories, each with a clear primary management objective: biodiversity zones, catchment zones, production zones, and non-forest zones. These categories could be applied to almost any country's forests. What is distinctive in Seychelles is that almost all the forest falls into one of the first two categories, biodiversity and catchment.
BIODIVERSITY ZONES.
The Biodiversity Zones are primarily for conservation of biological diversity and indigenous ecosystems. Controlled tourism can be permitted, except where it is likely to harm conservation. Any timber exploitation should be of exotic species only and will aim at enhancing indigenous flora and fauna. Any planting will be of indigenous species, preferably rare endemics, wherever possible. Limited exploitation of minor forest products (fruits, nuts, leaves, medicinal plants) may be permitted in certain cases.
The inner islands of Seychelles have a very high level of endemism. The indigenous flora and fauna has been devastated by man's exploitation, exotic species and fire in a mere 250 years. Fortunately, most indigenous plants have avoided extinction, although there is virtually none of any original ecological community remaining. Instead, the indigenous flora survives in small inaccessible craggy areas or scattered in forests with a high proportion of exotic species. These remnants are of global importance and the challenge for Seychelles, with the help of the international community, is to stop the decline of the indigenous flora and fauna, and ultimately to restore examples of predominantly indigenous ecological communities. This is the primary aim of the Biodiversity Zones. The proposed Biodiversity Zones cover 860 ha in Mahé, 390 ha in Curieuse, 30 ha in La Digue and 480 ha in Silhouette. At present all of significant proportion of exotic plants. Mangroves are included for their ecological value to the nation, although they are of less international similar to mangrove ecosystems elsewhere in the world. · Praslin, 290 ha in the zones include a high biological and significance, being.
In addition to the current presence of indigenous vegetation and/or specific rare endemics, a number of factors have to be considered in selecting the areas:Altitudinal range: Altitude is a major determinant of vegetation type. Since most of this mixed "natural" forest is at high altitude, some of the lowland species are surviving at the limit of their ecological range. This adds to the importance of any lower altitude conservation areas and of zones with a wide altitudinal range (Jasmin part of Morne Seychellois, and Silhouette). It also highlights a problem with concentric zonation schemes based on altitude. Size: Small patches of indigenous vegetation may not be viable in the long-term. Where feasible, management should aim to expand outwards from these relict patches to cover a wider area, perhaps linking two or more patches. Physical isolation: Zones which occupy whole islands can, once cleared of most exotics, have a lower rate of re-invasion than in forest patches surrounded by e.g. cinnamon and albizia. This makes them cheaper to conserve in long term. Practicability of conservation: This includes issues such as land ownership and the likely availability of funds and personnel to manage the area.
Local experts should identify accurate boundaries in field. As this study focused on forested areas only in the inner islands, other sites should be added to the list, i.e. those valued for birds or for other non-forest flora and fauna, marine areas etc., for the purposes of defining a comprehensive map of Seychelles biodiversity conservation areas. The network of biodiversity zones is not static. It should be reviewed regularly and areas added, if there is additional information, increased conservation capability, or specific opportunities.
CATCHMENT ZONES.
Catchment Zones are primarily for conservation of water, soil and amenity. In Mahé, most of the forest falls into this category. All the Catchment Zones are divided into two sub-zones, according to the secondary aim of management. The secondary aims are: · Biodiversity conservation, where feasible · Production, where this is economic (e.g. close to a road) and appropriate (not close to rivers or in areas of notable beauty).
In addition, rehabilitation of productivity, particularly in degraded areas, will be an important issue. Exploitation will be of exotic species only, except in plantations and private lands, and will use sensitive, selective techniques. When planting, the choice between indigenous and exotic species will depend on the secondary aim. Invasive exotics will not be planted. This zone includes a number of small plantations of exotic timber trees, which mostly are not economic to harvest due to the difficult terrain and distance from roads. They will generally be left unused. The Catchment Zones include all the main river catchment areas, including the River Reserves. The Catchment Zones include also most of the potable water resources as described in NLUP. It should also be noticed that the protection of Catchment Zones might have a direct positive impact on the protection of coastal areas by reducing erosion and subsequent siltation. 2.10 PRODUCTION ZONES.
The Production Zones are primarily for production forestry. In Seychelles these zones will mainly be plantations. They may be of fast-growing species for construction timber or of slower growing, more valuable hardwoods. The production forests will always be managed in a manner compatible with soil and water conservation, so they are not located in steep areas. The species to be planted will be chosen mainly on economic grounds, so they are more likely to be exotics than indigenous species. However, invasive exotic species will not generally be planted. · For forest management purposes, the main Production Zones are delineated in compartments, which should be relatively heterogeneous. The vegetation type is the main criterion for delineation. For operational purposes, the compartments will be further divided into smaller units, i.e. stands.
Production operations will be carried out so that the view to the forests remains undisturbed. Relatively small areas are harvested at a time. Strip fellings along contours and selective cuttings are favoured. The vegetation cover will be maintained continuously. Soil and water conservation is not, however, as important as in catchment forests. Anyhow, special care will be taken to ensure soil and water protection also during regeneration. Management of production forests could include protection, monitoring, and exploitation whenever economically feasible. Production forests should be subject to detailed forest management planning. So far, no detailed management planning has been carried out, except that of P.T. Henry (1976), which concentrated on plantation forests. In the Forestry Section, management decisions have been based on thorough personal knowledge on the existing forests and long experience on forestry in the country. However, unforeseen changes in the senior forestry staff may put the forest management into peril. The discussion on the management of production forests presented below applies also to the production sub-zone of Catchment Forests. Exploitation of the 23 main timber species is controlled by a system of licenses (for merchants, issued by the Licensing Department) and permits. The control is labour intensive,.
involving a site visit by the Timber Control Unit for each tree. Size limits are set according to species and site quality. The sites should be classified as good, medium or poor, but in the absence of clear classification criteria the site quality is generally ignored, or in practice almost always classified as "medium". Most of the timber is obtained from private land, following an agreement between the landowner and timber merchant. It is widely felt that timber merchants pay poor prices to landowners. Merchants also cut some trees in forests on state land, paying a royalty. It is rumoured that significant numbers of trees are cut illegally, but quantities have not been estimated. Enforcement is difficult, because: · FS usually hears about the illegal felling days or weeks afterwards · Local residents are not authorised to ask to see permits · FS chooses to use the police to arrest people and pursue prosecutions. It is said that some local police do not consider illegal felling to be an offence worth pursuing vigorously · As the forests on state land have not been gazetted as forest reserve, there is no legal way to prosecute illegal timber fellers operating in state lands. The threat posed by timber exploitation to soil and water conservation appears to be small. In forested areas secondary forest vegetation, almost always exotic, will usually re-grow. No felling is allowed in "river reserves", unless the tree poses a danger. In more open areas such risks should be detected by the Timber Control Unit, who would in most cases refuse permission for felling. The Timber Control Unit should also be able to prevent felling which will adversely affect the scenic beauty of an area. Of the 23 species listed, 2 are endemic and a further 5 are indigenous. There is a policy against felling the endemic species. However, there is no legal basis to enforce this policy. An additional list of indigenous trees has been prepared to ad to the schedule of the Breadfruit and Other Trees Act. For time being, there should be no cutting of endemic species on state land. Cutting of nonendemic indigenous species should also be carefully controlled. The native trees are anyway fighting a losing battle against invasive exotics. On private land, the policy cannot be so rigid or it may discourage people from planting indigenous species. A landowner should be allowed to fell certain endemic or indigenous species, provided that (s)he can demonstrate a firm intention to replant and tend. This would only apply to non-endangered species, which are regenerating naturally or for which propagation methods are known. A requirement to wait one season to allow seed collection may be imposed. On private land, replanting and tending has to be the responsibility of the landowner. A permit to fell a tree, which is not causing any problems, should be denied if the landowner has not fulfilled commitments to tend regeneration after previous fellings on his/her land. On state land, a system for replanting and tending of gaps after felling should be established. In the Production Zones, which are or will become mainly plantations, this would be part of an intensive management system including an inventory. In Catchment Zones, most cutting would be within the sub-zones for which production is a secondary objective. Replanting in these sub-zones could be with indigenous trees or, in most cases, non-invasive exotics. There could be some cutting of invasive exotics in the biodiversity sub-zones, but the gaps would be planted with indigenous species, which would never be felled.
It is suggested that the FS should divide the total area of the Production Zones and production sub-zones of Catchment Zones into a number of compartments, to be exploited in rotation. This will facilitate the replanting and tending work. The allowable exploitation must be limited not only by sustainability but also by the primary objective of protecting the catchment area. The possibility of leasing concessions could be considered. The present system of inspection and permit should be retained, but DOE should make additional use of the considerable investment of time and transport. To encourage private land tree growing, FS should help landowners get more money for their trees. FS could issue statistics on recent market prices for timber trees and inform the landowner of these prices during the inspection visit. Honorary forest rangers should be appointed in various localities to help prevent illegal felling. Both they and FS rangers should be trained in how to require to see permits and to arrest people where necessary. The police should be made more aware of the need to enforce environmental legislation, including forest protection. A list of highly invasive exotic species should be prepared, their royalties substantially reduced or even abolished, and the minimum harvesting size could be scrapped. Legal protection for endemic and indigenous trees should be reinforced. 2.11 NON-FOREST ZONES.
Substantial amounts of trees can be found in agricultural and housing areas. In these nonforest zones, the primary objective for tree growing is amenity, particularly the conservation of scenic beauty, shade and production of non-timber outputs such as fruits, nuts, honey, etc. An important secondary aim is the conservation of the gene pool of indigenous species, many of which were once predominantly lowland species but are now confined to highlands. In the non-forest zones, tree cutting will be carefully controlled and the growing of indigenous trees will be encouraged. 2.12 2.12.1 DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY OF FOREST PRODUCTS Sawn wood.
The sawn wood consumption is estimated at about 8,000 m³. Since the mid-1980s it has been growing at an average annual rate of 6.4%. About a third of the consumption is hardwoods, considerably less than in the mid-1980s. Softwood is entirely imported pine while hardwoods include several local species and imported mahogany, meranti and some other species. 2.12.2 Wood-based Panels.
The total consumption of wood-based panels was 3,300 m3 in 1991. As there is no local production, all the panels are imported. Most (about 90%) of wood-based panels are plywood or block board while the share or particleboard and fibreboard has been marginal. In fibreboard, medium-density fibreboard (MDF) is increasingly imported replacing traditional hardboard and solid wood.
Further Processed Products.
It was not possible to establish the market size in this sub-sector due to problems related to measurement of different products. This group includes such items as doors and door frames, windows, kitchen cabinets, roof trusses, furniture, pallets, craft products,... These products are mainly produced locally by carpenters, small-scale wood-working plants and a few medium-scale operations, which are part of larger construction companies mainly producing for their own projects. 2.12.4 Paper and Paper Products.
The average annual consumption of paper and paper products has been at the level of 1,300 tons/year There is a clear growth trend, which is a result of three main factors: (i) increasing educational level, (ii) higher disposable income, and (iii) the emergence of the multi-party system. In an international comparison, a higher than average share of converted products is imported. This is due to the small size of the market not allowing the necessary economics of scale needed in the establishment of local production. Paper and paper products are not discussed in the following as their future demand will be met by imports with the exception of a few further processed products which can be manufactured locally based on imported paper and board (e.g. toilet paper). 2.12.5 Fuel wood and Charcoal.
Due to electrification and urbanization the use of fuel wood has been declining drastically. The current rate is estimated to be 8% of the energy consumption. The National Youth Service (NYS) used to be a major fuel wood user as food in their villages was cooked by using fuel wood. The substantial consumption (estimated at about 3,500-4,000 m³) was largely met by casuarina supplied from the outer islands (Islands Development Company). In rural areas traditional bakeries still bake bread using fuel wood. Bakeries are also changing to use electricity and the consumption trend is downwards. The main use of charcoal is in hotels and restaurants for barbecue. It is estimated that 40 tons of charcoal is consumed by this sub sector. The main users produced their own charcoal using wood from their own forests. Even this use is diminishing as the hotels and restaurants are turning more and more to gas or other fuels even for barbecue. Household consumption is negligible. As a whole the wood fuels consumption is currently (1992) estimated at about 5,500 m³ in wood volume equivalent. The respective figure in the mid-1980s was probably in the range of 15,000 m³. 2.12.6 Non-wood Forest Products.
It is estimated that there are 250 to 500 plants with curative properties in Seychelles. Traditional medicine is still widely practiced, particularly among the older people. The Technical Support Services Division of the Department of Industry is presently conducting a survey and analysis of the medicinal plants of Seychelles with financing from EC. The project is establishing a national data bank with information on species distribution, chemical and.
pharmaceutical properties, and ethno-botanical knowledge. In-vitro propagation of the promising species will be introduced. The most important non-wood forest product is however coco-de-mer which brings to the government more revenue than wood production. The market is controlled by the government, which buys and sells the nuts. Palmiste (Deckenia nobilis), and other palms, are cut down for "heart-of-palm" salad. The total quantity of heart-of-palm salad consumed annually in hotels and airlines is estimated to be 9,000 palms per year (1993), but how much of this is genuine palmiste is doubtful. Beekeeping has been developed on small scale, with 15 beekeepers on Mahé and 10 on Praslin with about 300 colonies. In spite of local production, honey is being imported. There is a taste preference for local honey, and the market demand is good. Beekeeping is mainly based on agricultural flowering plants. However, part of the nectar surely originates from forest trees and shrubs, and there could be scope for expanding beekeeping in forest areas. Beekeeping is a good example of sustainable multi-purpose land use, which can be practised jointly with forestry. Beekeeping, if properly managed, does not have a slightest degradation effect on the resource base. On the contrary, e.g. the incidences of forest fires could be reduced if controlled beekeeping was practised in forest areas because the beekeepers would take an interest in preventing and controlling fires in areas where they have invested in beehives. Other important non-wood products are raw materials for craft industries: e.g. palm leaves and other fibres for straw hats. There are some bamboo reserves, which could be used locally for craft and furniture industries, but this resource has not yet been tapped. 2.12.7 Tourism and Recreation.
The scenic beauty and amenity provided by the forests is the main, even if indirect, economic benefit of the forests of Seychelles. Without the forests, and the wildlife the forests provide habitat for, the tourism would not likely be there. Another aspect, not less important from the tourism's point of view, is the biodiversity of the forests; it is not only the beauty of the green tropical islands that lure the tourists in, but also the fame of the unique ecology and rare species of both flora and fauna of the country. The so-called eco-tourism is likely to be a rapidly expanding non-price sensitive industry, and Seychelles is in an excellent position to tap it. The number of tourists using nature trails or going on nature walks in forests on Mahé is not known, but is probably small. Specialist groups of botanists or ornithologists are very few, probably less than 1% of the total market. Residents, especially expatriates, make use of the forests for recreation. The total number of visitors can be expected to resume its upward trend, when the global recession is over. The Tourism Department plans to launch a new marketing image for Seychelles, with a stronger eco-tourism element added to the sun, sea and sand. This can be expected to stimulate demand for the easily accessible forest areas, with good visitor services. Limited nature tourism could help conservation by increasing forest monitoring by guides. Two points to emphasize are:.
Forest trails on Mahé and Silhouette should not be expected to make large profits from entry fees, though associated services (guiding, transport) may be profitable. The main motives for increasing tourist use of forests are to diversify the range of experiences open to tourists, to build up the image of Seychelles as an ecologically unique destination, and to increase Seychellois awareness and expertise in relation to the unique flora and fauna. Even with an eco-tourism campaign, specialist groups will always be a small minority, probably less than 5%. They are nevertheless an important market sector to cater for, because they help in building up the image and raising international support for, and scientific interest in, conservation of Seychelles' forests. SUPPLY OF WOOD PRODUCTS Timber.
2.13 2.13.1.
The vegetation type map was used for the estimation of the annual allowable cut, i.e. the timber supply. The present forest cover by forest types was reviewed using the existing aerial photographs, maps, registers and field visits in selected areas. The volume data was sampled from 35 plots and compiled with the data of Henry's (1976) permanent sample plots. The measurements of the present study were mainly done in plantations using relascope technique. The annual allowable cut (i.e. sustainable production potential) of timber is estimated only for Production and Catchment/Production Zones. Biodiversity and Catchment/Biodiversity Zones are excluded, as commercial harvesting should not be allowed in them. The annual allowable cut is presented in Table.
The volumes include all the species including coconut timber from coconut dominant forests. The Non-forest Zone includes the allowable cut from house gardens, coconut plantation, etc. The log volumes include stems and branches with minimum diameter of 20 cm and total volumes include, in addition to log volumes, stems and branches with minimum diameter of 5 cm.
Local Production.
Sawnwood is the main local wood product. There are three sawmills in the country, of which only one is in operation. All of them have circular saws. The mill in Desroches and the mill in Baie St. Anne, Praslin island, are no longer used. The only operational sawmill is situated in Grand Anse. In 1992 a team of expatriate specialists analysed the mill's development possibilities and the techno-economic analysis concluded that the sawmill is unlikely to be financially viable in the foreseeable future (CFTD 1992).
Most of local hardwood lumber is produced manually by chain saws or handsaws in the forest areas. There are estimated to be 26 teams of which 11 operate in Mahé and 15 in Praslin. The teams normally comprise 2-3 members and carrying of planks to roadside may be done by other casual labour. Three teams were interviewed during the course of study and the major characteristics of their operations can be summarized as follows:.
The surface quality of sawing is moderate, depending on the skills of the persons The dimensions of the sawn timber may have over 10 % of variation in thickness and over 5% in width, which causes considerable losses in further processing The amount of production depends on the species (i.e. hardness of the wood) Long blade chain saws are used which causes a lot of waste A group may work in any part of an island, or even move between islands The workers are paid by produced running feet The sawyers work quite permanently with the same group but the skidders may change with the change of the area The waste is normally left in the forest and local farmers may use it for their constructions.
A team is estimated to produce on average 200 running feet of 1-2" x 8-10" planks or 0.4 m³/day. The total pit sawn production is 1,200 m³/year. Part of local timber supply comes from individual trees cut in residential areas. In addition to teams working in the forest, there are some professional tree fellers who have specialized in this activity. The total sawn wood production in the country is estimated to be 2,000 m³ (1992). The available production is insufficient to meet local demand, which clearly prefers local species. As a result, illegal logging occurs. The Forestry Section issued timber licenses to 2,240 m³ in 1992, which covers 45% of the total production (assuming a recovery rate of 45%). Illegal felling mostly takes place on Mahé as informal control in Praslin and La Digue makes it more difficult to carry out clandestine harvesting. It is also assumed that some pit sawing takes place in other islands but the volumes are likely to be rather marginal. Charcoal is produced in the forest areas using logging waste and no permit is needed. The operating sawmill in Grand Anse converts part of its production waste into charcoal. Charcoal is also produced in Desroches and some other IDC operated islands based on casuarina. Also a few hotels and restaurants, which use charcoal for barbecue, produce charcoal of their own. The annual production is estimated to be 50 tons and it more than fully meets the demand. Crafts: There is a small, but assumable growing, crafts industry using mainly local hard woods, often cut from trees outside forests. The wooden items include e.g. carvings and inlaid jewellery boxes. The market of the crafts industry is completely dependent on tourism. CODEVAR is providing some training and also carries out promotional work for the artisans. The amount of raw material needed is very small, and thus can easily be met. 2.13.3 Imports.
The main import sources are the Republic of South Africa in pine sawn wood and wood-based panels and Southeast Asia in sawn hardwood and plywood. The distribution by main sources.
has been rather stable over the last few years, which is partly due to the fact that transportation connections are a major factor influencing the CIF price of imported products. 2.13.4 Exports.
There have been no recorded exports of wood products. Most of the wood-based handicraft souvenir production however serves the tourism industry and is exported. This important market could be developed further and a certain demand has been identified for knockdown smaller size furniture made of local timbers which visiting tourists are interested in buying. The about 100,000 tourists visiting Seychelles annually represent a market potential which can be tapped by small and medium-scale producers provided that raw material is available and quality meets the customer requirements. The market segment is not price-sensitive and can absorb the relatively high local production costs. A major investment is being undertaken by the largest importer of wood products to substantially increase capacity for further processing of imported sawn wood. The company intends to serve both the local and regional export markets. 2.14 DEMAND AND SUPPLY BALANCE.
In contrast to the annual allowable cut, the production potential estimates include only accessible forest areas. The accessibility was estimated by vegetation type. The production potential estimates for a period of twenty years are presented in Table 2.
Production potential by species was not possible to estimate due to inadequate field information. Species composition in each stand should be studied when the detailed management plans are prepared. The 8,600 m³ of hardwood saw logs would produce about 3,400 m³ of sawn timber, which is the estimated demand for hardwood sawn timber in 2002. There will be a growing deficiency of saw logs, which needs to be covered by increasing imports. In long term this deficiency may be reduced by investments in tree growing. Fuel wood surplus will continue growing with diminishing demand.
2.15 2.15.1.
SECTORAL OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES National Development Objectives.
Economic objectives: The development objectives of the forestry sector can be derived from the national development objectives, which have been largely expressed in EMPS. Consequently, the forestry sector should aim at: · Enhancement of the amenity and conservation of biodiversity and environment at large, and thus improving the major comparative advantage of the national tourist industry · Sustainability of the productive potential of land by providing adequate tree cover and thus protection of land from erosion · Sustainability of water supply by improving the water retention capacity of soil, controlling erosion, and protecting rivers, waterways, dams and coastal areas · Import substitution by producing wood- and non-wood based forest goods and services whenever economically feasible, producing sustainably high-quality raw material for local small-scale wood-based industry, including the artisanal sector · Employment creation by providing challenging employment opportunities, particularly for youths Environmental Objectives: The forestry sector has the following long-term environmental objectives: · Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems · Provision of habitat for endemic flora and fauna · Prevent any further extinction of the unique flora and fauna of Seychelles · Maintain or improve forest cover in catchment areas of the inner islands, thereby protecting the potable water resources, as well as the coastal areas against erosion and siltation. · In defined zones of Mahé, Praslin, Silhouette and Curieuse, increase gradually the proportion of indigenous species until the forest becomes predominantly indigenous · Maintain the beauty of the forested landscape of Seychelles · Increase the commitment and capability of the local people to conserve their environment 2.16 2.16.1 SECTORAL DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES Priorities.
It is expected that tourism, particularly eco-tourism, will continue to grow in global scale thus providing further development opportunities for the country. Forests are the backbone of this resource base. Consequently, environmental conservation and maintenance of the biodiversity should be the first priority of the sector. The following aims are recommended: · Management plans prepared and implemented · Forest Policy prepared and adopted · Human resource development plan for DOE prepared and implemented · Expansion of the quantity and diversity of indigenous, particularly endemic, tree seedlings produced in nurseries · Conservation of the most endangered or valuable plant species.
Due to the extremely limited land area, and sensitive soils and water balance in Seychelles, it is extremely important to conserve the limited soil and water resources of the country. If these resources are endangered, it is not only the Seychellois society and economy that will suffer, but also the nature. Consequently, conservation of soil and water resources should be the second priority of the sector. The second priority would require the following aims: · Effective prevention and complete control of forest fires · Adequate reforestation of deforested areas · Effective protection of all the main rivers and their catchment areas Due to the vulnerability caused by the high dependency on only one revenue source (tourism), and due to the risks involved in the future of long-distance travelling, it is important for Seychelles to attempt to diversify, to certain extent, its economy. As large-scale timber production would seriously conflict with the first priority objective, the development of smallscale wood industries and particularly industries based on non-wood forest products should be the third priority of the sector. The third priority would include the following aims: · Increased knowledge on and use of the medicinal plants, including cultivation of selected species · Increased production of high value-added wood and non-wood forest products to be marketed for local, tourist and export markets 2.16.2 Strategic Guidelines.
The strategy for achieving the sectoral objectives has the following elements: · Improve the planning, coordination and monitoring capacities of FS and DOE to enable them to fully benefit from the available external support and the national opportunities for increased mobilization of NGO and private sectors for conservation and sustainable utilization of forest resources. · Promote formal education, on-the-job training and organize short courses on special subjects to improve the skills and efficiency of forestry staff on all levels. Training and short courses should be also made available for NGOs, district staff, guard civil, private sector, etc. as appropriate. · Mobilize human resources also outside DOE as the implementation of this plan demands more skilled people than are available in DOE. Fortunately, environmental work is inherently participatory and there are many people who could be mobilized and given the basic skills. DOE needs an extension programme to motivate and facilitate participation by other individuals and agencies. DOE's training programme should combine intensive development of its own skilled personnel with a practical training service to non-DOE participants in conservation. · Build up revenue sources for financial sustainability. Whilst EMPS 1990-2000 has successfully risen much capital funding, sustainability depends on adequate recurrent financing. Biodiversity conservation is particularly dependent on an increased, reliable income base. In addition to Government financing through DOE, the strategy should develop the capability of SIF and other NGOs to generate income for conservation, through tourism and other means. · Define clear forest policy and improve and make use of legislation. DOE should prepare a forest policy, and an updated conservation policy and process them. DOE should incorporate the forestry legislation in the on-going conservation legislation review. The National Land Use Plan should be institutionalised, but not in a way which is totally rigid. The culture of using legislation has to be established in DOE.
Zone the forests in the field according to their primary objective. This will help ensure that all management activities contribute towards a clear objective. The three objectives used are (a) conservation of biological diversity and indigenous ecosystems, (b) conservation of water, soil and amenity, and (c) production of wood and non-wood forest products. Prepare and implement Management Plans for Biodiversity, Catchment and Production Zones. The plans for different zones will differ in structure and contents, as the management objectives are different. Production Zones and Catchment/Production Zones should be covered with rather ordinary Forest Management Plans. Biodiversity and Catchment/Biodiversity Zones should be covered with plans focusing on biodiversity and soil and water resources conservation. Basically, all zones will be covered with respective plans irrespective their ownership status. As the Production Zones will include only state forests, the most detailed Forest Management Plans will be prepared only for state lands. The other zones include both state and private lands. The respective plans to be prepared are considered as zonal plans thus covering also private lands. However, prior to actual planning work, approval should be sought from the respective private landowners. Promote tree growing outside forests. Through awareness raising and extension work local people will be given information on various multipurpose tree species, including medicinal plants, suitable for home gardens. Forest nurseries will produce seedlings of such species for sale. Re-orient nurseries to produce more seedlings of indigenous species. An immediate effort must be made to increase dramatically the production of indigenous seedlings of trees and other plants for the management of the biodiversity and catchment zones. Since propagation techniques are not well known, and even less well recorded, the initial production efforts will have to be carefully monitored so that they can serve as research trials. Other institutions and landowners should be encouraged to participate in both propagating and growing indigenous plants. Provide support and technical assistance for the crafts, saw milling and other industries using both wood and non-wood forest products. This should include production development, processing techniques, and marketing. Some technical assistance should be given also for the wood processing industries from the sawmills to the carpenters. This should aim at improving the quality of the products, product development towards higher value-added products, reducing of the wastage, and use of non-traditional timbers, e.g. from fast growing plantations. Technical assistance should also be provided to the wood harvesting operators to improve their skills, productivity, and working safety. Participate actively in regional (Indian Ocean, Eastern African, etc.) cooperation programmes. This would bring in relevant experience and expertise needed in the country. FOREST DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME Conservation of Biodiversity.
2.17 2.17.1.
Integrated Management of Biodiversity Zones Biodiversity Zones have been selected on the basis of existing botanical information, including presence of rare species, with consideration given to altitudinal range, size, physical isolation and whether conservation is feasible. A detailed management plan for the park should be also prepared, and the plan implemented. It is proposed that the plan be prepared for a period of ten years. Thereafter the plan should be.
reviewed and up-dated. The first management plan could be a simple one. Early in the planning process, it should be possible to draft park regulations, which should be gazetted as soon as possible. The regulations may refer to the different zones of the park. Certain regulations, e.g. on planting exotic species or lighting fires, will apply also within this zone. The inhabited zone should not be allowed to continue creeping along the roads. Such development would affect catchment protection, scenic value and also biodiversity conservation. Seychelles' forests are already small and division of the forest into smaller areas could subdivide populations of some rare species, with adverse effects on their long-term viability. The plan should also clarify management responsibilities, so that there can be accountability in plan implementation One of the key problems to be tackled is the invasion of exotic species. The most costeffective approach to improve the biodiversity zones is probably to focus effort on sustained management of forest gaps, whether natural or made by clearing exotics. By tending indigenous seedlings (planted or spontaneous) and removing exotics in the gaps, a gradual reversion back towards indigenous forest may be achieved. An anti-albizia ring-barking campaign would help stop the spread of albizia, but it should be followed by several years of gap management. Otherwise the albizia will be replaced by cinnamon, agati and more albizia. The ability of prune de France to invade indigenous forest needs to be assessed. Where prune de France and bracken fern are colonizing a bare area, which would otherwise suffer erosion, they should probably be allowed to do so. Once the soil is sufficiently stabilized, contour lines could be cleared for trees to be planted and tended until they grew over the invaders. Because of lower rates of re-invasion, the work to prevent re-invasion of a forest cleaned of exotics should be less in physically isolated areas, i.e. small islands, than in a Biodiversity Zone surrounded by cinnamon-dominated forest in Mahé. The task can be made easier by avoiding planting invasive species and by tightening up controls to prevent the introduction of new problem species. The control of invasive species is inevitably labour-intensive. FS policy must therefore explore possibilities for additional manpower. FS personnel policy should include identification and training of some labourers in the particular skills required. There should be official recognition of, and payment for, this special skill. Management plans should be gradually prepared for all the Biodiversity Zones. The following management issues should be addressed in these plans: · Removal of exotic species and subsequent management of forest gaps. This should focus initially on the best patches of indigenous forest within the zone, and then gradually expand outward to cover the whole zone. This will be a long-term activity · Fire prevention and control, and treatment of burnt areas, especially for Praslin National Park · Protection against harvesting of timber, medicinal plants and other non-wood products, through boundary marking, patrols and the use of honorary wardens/rangers · Management of park visitors, to protect the environment, ensure visitor satisfaction, and, where appropriate, collect revenue · Extension and education work with forest neighbours, tour operators using the forest, local leaders, teachers, NGOs and interested individuals. The aim is to encourage wide, active participation in conservation of these biodiversity zones.
Promotion of a specific public image for each park or biodiversity zone, to motivate people participating in conservation and to help generate revenue, e.g. Morne Seychellois National Park = the protector of water, and hence life, for Seychelles Gradual replacement of exotic plantations with mixed indigenous forest, which will never be harvested Rehabilitation of degraded areas with a mixture of indigenous species, combined with mechanical means (e.g. terracing, lock-and-spill drains) where appropriate Monitoring of the ecological state of the zone, the status of rare or ecologically important species, and the achievement of management targets Research on the dynamics of forest regeneration, autecology and propagation of rare species, the process of invasion by exotics, fire ecology and the distribution of flora and fauna.
Where the Biodiversity Zone is on private land , DOE should seek a management agreement with the landowner, to ensure appropriate management. Gazettement as a Special Nature Reserve could be considered, if agreed with the owner.
3.1 3.1.1 OUTLOOK OF THE LIKELY STATE OF FOREST RESOURCES IN 2020 CHANGES CONNECTED WITH THE FOREST RESOURCES Socio-economic changes.
Positive: · Reclamation of land will eventually relieve pressure for development and construction on the narrow strip of coastal land e.g. Mangrove forest. It will reduce the demand for more land for development (housing) and construction, thus reduce the amount of encroachment into upland forest areas · Desalination could help to diminish the rising demand for fresh water Negative: Rapid urbanization on the existing narrow band of coastal land destroying coastal forest biodiversit y · Progressive encroachment into forested areas as the demand for more land is increasing as the population is on the rise · Reclamation of the east coast will lead to the destruction of the existing forest biodiversity · With the increase in the distribution and density of population in forested areas, water catchments areas will be affected leading to disruptions in the water cycle.
Overall economic performance - Eco-tourism development.
Positive: · Allow visitors to enjoy the rich biological diversity of the forest resources · Add value to forest resources through upgraded of present infrastructures in your forest areas e.g. eco-tourism facilities · Zoning of the forest areas, where different activities could be carried out sustainably · Cater for specific groups to undertake scientific research/study for the benefits of the country · Greater participation of other stakeholders in the promotion of eco-tourism.
Negative: · Bound to have illegal activity, including illegal poaching, harvesting of the species and other detrimental activities to the forest diversity · Pressure due to increased activities in protected areas · Disturbance of natural ecosystems through maintenance activities · Conflict due to policy imposed on local populations 3.1.3 Development in the agricultural sector.
Positive: · Demand for forested land for agricultural production will gradually decrease as the Government continues to import some vegetables, fruits and meat · The practice of upland farming is on the decrease, as most farmers are reverting to farming on the coast. The number of people practicing intensive/extensive farming is on the decrease-ex-farmers reverting to other jobs Negative: · Demand for practicing upland farming where specific crops such as yams and other crops thrive best in areas where forest is situated 3.1.4 Policy and institutional changes.
Most particular changes with regard to ownership and management of forest resources: Positive: · A new Division, the Policy Planning and Services has been set up with the aim of meeting requirements of change · Any development around the buffer zones around Protected areas needs EIA's · Basically all the active NGO's in the country are for Conservation, protection and safeguarding of the environment natural resources · Several organizations and bodies exist which are there to ensure that development is done in a sustainable way and in harmony with the environment e.g. Town and Country Planning, Planning Authority --Board, Seychelles Licensing Authority, EIA's etc · Forestry related legislation are being revised/amended and will continue to be revised when there is the need. New laws are superseding old laws Negative: · Lack of harmony and coordination between the law and the juridical procedures 3.1.5 Industrial Development and its impact on Forestry.
Even though industrial development is on the increase, the forest is still unscathed at present even though with the boom in construction: Positive: · Industrial development will not be permitted, as most forest areas are located within the protected areas and for any construction an EIA.s is requested.
For example the bottling of water follows strict guidelines, in the sense that the water catchments areas need to be protected. Trees are not felled and water collected in designated areas All industrial activities are concentrated on the old reclaimed area along the coast As most of the timber is imported, the demand for local timber will not rise significantly even though there is a deficit in the economy.
Negative: · Demand for raw materials from forestry goods will be on the increase. More local products will flood the local markets e.g. crafts work · At least for the coming few years, there will be a demand for local timber with the construction of some five star hotels as the traditional architecture and Creole spirit are to be maintained · The depletion of existing plantation due to non-replanting on commercial trees will put a pressure on indigenous stand 3.1.6 Development in the services and their impacts.
Positive: · Services will be on the increase. The trends of Hotel construction in forested areas e.g. islands are to develop and promote eco-tourism where nature can co-exist with tourist activity. Practice on Fregate and Bird islands Negative: · Trends of hotel buildings are on islands and higher upland where there is a splendid view of the coast · Eco-tourism development where the forests are to be explored. As a result, new facilities such as tracks, buildings have to be built in the forestry areas to cater for the demand, thus clearing of the forestry areas · Disturbances of the forest ecosystem through the every day activities that are associated with eco-tourism e.g. maintenance, noise, and people's presence... 3.1.7 Trends in investment in the Forestry Sector.
Positive: · Through the change of prioritisation from Forestry Plantations to Forestry biodiversity Conservation/protection, funding from both local and international donors have increased substantially and will continue to be · More research work are being done by scientists on the resources that are found in the forest · Investment will be more on aesthetic value, non-wood resources of the forest resources and control harvesting of species Negative: · With time the trend of commercial forestry will be very marginal. Fewer revenues will be generated as control on the number of species and type of species being harvested will be strongly regulated by the Government · It is likely that in 10 years time the country will face a shortage of timber for local market and possibly force a trend to revert to indigenous tree species. This will effect negatively on indigenous stands.
State of natural forest ­ Area under sustainable management.
Positive: · There is the restoration biodiversity programme with the aim of returning the forest to its native state · More trees are planted as a way to increase the forest cover on the islands such as the replacement of trees being killed by diseases and the planting on the freshly reclaimed area · With the new reclaimed area, more land will be made available to reduce the pressure from encroachment in forest areas for housing and other development · The tree felling activity on private property is becoming more and more stringent where in certain areas trees are not allowed to be felled e.g. 30 m on either side of the riverbank · In area under sustainable management, the state decides on the number of trees to be felled. Thinning is being practiced as a means to maintain a healthy stock of timber in the plantations Negative: · Aggressive invasive plant species are colonizing, displacing and killing the native tree species · Several tree and plant disease are killing several of the endemic as well as the indigenous tree species, which have been in Seychelles for centuries · With the demand for more land for development, encroachment into forest areas is still and will still occur · Illegal activities through poaching especially of the endemic species 3.1.9 State of trees outside forest.
Positive: · Several landowners are aware on the needs to have some trees on the properties, as they know the benefits · In Seychelles trees are not felled for fuel consumption, or for making charcoal or for timber. The majority of tree felling request is because of the potential danger to houses or are in the way where farming or construction activities are to take place · It is the state that regulates the felling of trees, harvesting of goods on any property (private or government) · Timber control activities are being expanded to cover also the environmental and forestry extension activities in private lands. The aim is to increase local awareness and to provide services to people who want to promote indigenous plants already growing on their land or who want to plant indigenous species · Forestry is aiming at producing and developing a multitude of products including nonwood products and services for tourism and the local population 3.1.10 Conservation of biodiversity and protective functions of forest.
Positive: · Emphasis has been placed whereby no trees of indigenous and native species are to be felled for commercial purposes from state lands, if it is not done according to an accepted permit which ensure that the felling is not endangering the sustainability of the species in the area.
The responsibilities vis-à-vis forest fire prevention, detection and fighting is high on the agenda. The Division of Environment maintains stocks of equipment. Prevention of fire outbreaks and effective forest fire fighting is amongst the highest priorities amongst forestry Sections' tasks The existing Forest Fire contingency plan is revised on a yearly basis The awareness of fire hazards is being improved through media sensitisation to the public (especially during dry periods) Elimination and control of aggressive invasive exotic plant species is a priority in forestry.
Negative: · As more areas are placed under protected systems, resources to manage them will become more thinly distributed implying that fewer resources will be available to monitor and manage forest resources · As people get less option to implement their activities, the stress on resulting forest resources outside Protected areas will be significant 3.1.11 State of park management and ecotourism.
Positive: · Some of the protected areas are being developed to become major centre for in-situ conservation of the indigenous native vegetation e.g. Vallee de Mai · A seed and a national herbarium centres are being established at the Biodiversity Centre at Barbarons. The Barbarons Biodiversity centre and the Botanical Garden will act as a centre for promoting ex-situ conservation · Enlargement of areas to be protected through designation of National Park, AONB statues Negative: · There is the general tendency to move away from commercial forestry plantation without realizing that this imply stronger pressure on native stands as soon as the existing plantations is depleted if no restocking is done 3.2 STATE OF FOREST INDUSTRIES.
Positive: · The forest industries will continue to exist but at a marginal level. Demand for the local market will be met through importation of timber (readily sawn into the sizes that you need) · Wood workshop will exist on a small-scale (few carpenters...). They will not be processing large quantities of wood. The technology being used will be of low-tech. Right now in Seychelles there is only one sawmill. The technologies are outdated and worn out. There is no plan to upgrade or build a new one Negative: · Reduced employment on a socio-economic basis · Alien invasive species, which could be commercialised, will be left to rot on the forest floor once removed.
WOOD DEMAND-SUPPLY SITUATION.
Positive: · Biomass will always be available to supply the domestic market thus resulting in a reduction of same as fuel for forest fires Negative: · There will always be a need to import industrial wood and other products, thus putting a stress on the country's economy 3.4 SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS.
Positive: Income/Revenue · Timber prices are being revised, preferably through a process of competing bids or through studying the maximum prices that will be paid. The prices of non-preferred exotic species are being reduced and the prices of e.g. Albania the most valuable indigenous species have risen · Employment · Development of human resources to face the challenges of forest management for multiple purposes is to be given the highest priority. In addition to increasing the level of formal education and practical skills of present staff, new staff members with adequate and appropriate background for higher technical and academic studies will be recruited and given the opportunity for further studies. The new EMPS makes provision for that · The level of motivation amongst the staff is continuously being improved through post upgrading, training, improvement of worker safety and introducing new incentives for extra work Food security · Food security for the forest animal dwellers will be on the increase. Through the planting of the indigenous trees in forestry plantations, the fruits, seeds and flowers provide food for many forest dwelling animals · Carbon sequestration · Maintaining the land areas under its present forest cover will be maintained and preferably increase. Planting trees for the above will be on the increase · An increase in forest areas implies an increased carbon sink potential for carbon sequestration Negative: Food Security for man will be on the decrease. · The Breadfruit and other trees (Protection) Act was enacted to protect the emergency food suppl y · During the World Wars. This legislation was passed regarding food security whereby certain fruits trees and trees of commercial values were encouraged to be planted and were protected under the law. Though still today, those fruit trees are still under the protected law, most of the foodstuff consumed by human is imported. Therefore planting trees for food the population security is not seen as important It might be difficult to get all sectors to agree on a negotiation.
FORESTRY AND ENVIRONMENT.
Positive: · Relevant forestry publications should be purchased and equipped in a library for reference · Links with international forestry institutions should be established · Encouraging forest researchers and research organizations to undertake research in Seychelles and directing it to be able to make good use out of it · Local research has to be limited into simple trials and establishing and measuring sample plots for growth and yield data · Whilst the conservation legislation is being revised, the Breadfruit and Other Trees Act is to be replaced by regulations which make a clear difference between species that need a) protected for conservation, b) controlled for sustainable utilization and c) unprotected due to their harmful impact on the indigenous species Negative: · Forestry Section needs be equipped adequately for the duties of forest fire fighting, forest conservation, reforestation, forest surveys and inventories in order to better-conserved biodiversit y · -The upgrading of the forestry section should through institutional strengthening (computers to the outstations e.g., for database storage) is necessary 3.6 OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE FOREST.
Land degradation Rehabilitation of degraded forestry lands is now given high priority and will continue to be so after fires or erosion caused by waves. Native and indigenous plants are to be used for rehabilitation. Introduced species will not be used unless in the worst degraded areas where native plants will not thrive. Forestry has established a prompt response programme for the rehabilitation of state land after fire occurrence. Watershed protection: An assessment of the river reserves for GIS mapping will be carried out jointly with PUC and MLUH. Mitigative and preventive measures are being undertaken with regard to the protection. Awareness of proper watershed management, of the river reserve regulations and the importance of mangroves are included in the environmental extension scheme. Mangroves: The last remnants of existing mangroves are being preserved. Where it is possible their areas are being enlarged. As more areas are converted to eco-tourism sites, their protective functions will be less, as people's presence within these areas will be more evident. As areas are opened up, species with socio-cultural values (e.g. medicinal plants) will be more exposed to poaching and in risk of danger to trampling, fires, and dynamic disturbances.

In its 1997 report to the Commission on Sustainable Development, the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests indicates that sustainable forest management may be inhibited by an undervaluation of forest goods and services. This undervaluation occurs because many of the goods and service provided by forests are not traded in markets. Without markets to signal scarcity and channel investment, it is unclear that there is sufficient investment in forest conservation and management. In particular, a number of economists and conservationists have argued that the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA) systematically understates the contribution of natural resources. More importantly, critics of the SNA suggest that because it only partially counts natural resource systems such as forests as capital, the system of accounts inherently favour economic activities that produce traded goods even if they deplete a country's natural resources. To examine this question and suggest remedies, the Policy and Planning Division of the FAO Forestry Department, under the responsibility of Yves C. Dubé, Forestry Officer (Planning), and in consultation with other FAO Technical Departments in particular the Economic and Social Department (Pratap Narain, Statistics Division), commissioned a paper by Jeffrey Vincent and John Hartwick in 1997, to review country experiences and identify a conceptual framework to better account for forest resources benefits. Four country case studies (Brazil, Chile, Philippines and Zimbabwe) were also commissioned, two of them having been sponsored by the World Bank through the Danish Trust Fund on Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development. Two expert meetings (June 1997 and February 1998) recommended to use the input from Vincent/Hartwick's report to adopt standards and procedures of the System of National Accounts (SNA) and its proposed extension, the Integrated System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA), as the generally accepted accounting framework by most countries. Based on this, FAO decided to prepare a report on the status and current efforts with regard to economic and environmental accounting for forestry. This was done through the FAO Academic and Research Institutions Partnership Programme (David Jackson, U. of Montana) and in close collaboration with UN Statistics Division (Alessandra Alfieri), Eurostat (Gérard Gie) and the World Bank Environmental Economics and Indicators Unit (John Dixon/Michael Linddal). The report is intended to inform on challenges, opportunities and limitations of incorporating forest resources in SNA. It is hoped that it will be reviewed by a wide and diverse audience with a view to improving its contents and helping identify the next most important steps to maintain and increase forestry investment to achieve sustainable forest management.

Introduction.
The United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), which are utilized by most countries in compiling data for macroeconomic policy analysis, have undergone changes in recent years to more broadly include natural resource assets and environmental phenomenon1. Likewise, since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, there has been greater and greater emphasis in forestry on "sustainable forest management". Concomitantly there have been corresponding increases in both the appreciation of the broad array of forest benefits and more widespread recognition of inappropriate or wasteful forest uses. As these changes in the forest policy environment have occurred, there has been an increasing demand for new macroeconomic policy analysis data and methods as countries seek ways to reconcile conflicts and find balancing points between the ecological, socio-cultural and economic matters which envelop forestry in the late twentieth century2. In order to more adequately address these issues, forest economists and national economic policy analysts will need revised conceptual models and new numerical foundations in forest sector analysis. Conventional national income accounting procedures (UN, 1993) include aggregate measures of forest sector activities. However, the forest sector account focuses on forests in a very narrow sense of the word. Only forest assets that have commercial timber value are included in the forest sector. As a result, the important linkages between forest production and wood product conversion are not included in estimates of valued added. Furthermore, many important forest sector activities are noncommercial in the sense that they lack market exchange values. While there are forests that should be classified as "non-commercial", these assets are still likely to be important environmental assets which provide many valued services such as fish and wildlife habitat protection, recreational use opportunities, watershed protection services, and climate modification functions that may result from carbon take-up and storage. Finally, some important forest products and services are typically reported in other economic sectors. For example, the value of wild berries, forest grazing, and game may be reported in the agriculture sector. The result of the broad approach to forest sector reporting is that policy analysts and policy makers who rely on national income accounts are not easily able to get a comprehensive anddetailed picture of the contributions of forests, both positive and negative, to societal wellbeing. As was just suggested, this is due primarily to the very nature and role of forests in any economy and the necessary lack of detail in SNA. Forest values are many. Several important values are not typically traded in the marketplace. And many values are reported in other economic sectors. But, in recent years, as the level of timber harvesting has escalated in many areas of the world to the point that sustainable long-term economic development is threatened, it has become clear that national income accounts could do a better job of helping to analyze sustainable development. Because stock estimates of forest land, timber and other valuable forest assets have not traditionally been included in the list of a nation's assets, depletion of forest assets can be severely understated. Furthermore, verification or investigation of sustainable development from the standpoint of long-term wealth.
The impetus for national income accounting accelerated in the 1950s following closely on the heals of the Great Depression and World War II. The most recent changes were instituted in 1993. See UN, 1993a and 1993b for more detailed description.
See for example, Mr. David Harcharik's address to the Eleventh World Forestry Congress (Harcharik, 1997) where he indicates that the future of world forestry is "sustainable forest management". Sustainable Forest management is seen as a synthesis of ecological, socio-cultural and economic matters into decision-making.
2 accumulation is beyond the scope of macroeconomic analysis if the nation's natural wealth endowment is not included in national income accounts3. Likewise, important environmental indicators such as the rate of deforestation or forest degradation are not reported so that these phenomena are easily overlooked. In recent years, there have been substantial changes in the System of National Accounts (SNA)which allow more detailed analysis and improved reporting of natural resource assets and environmental accounting UN (1993a, 1993b). These changes also provide for the introduction of satellite accounts or Systems of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA)4. The existence of an SEEA for the forestry sector in an economy will allow even more precise macroeconomic analysis. 1.2 Objectives.
This report presents and discusses the evolution and current status of forest sector satellite accounts in economic and environmental accounting. These accounts are presented in terms of their relationship to SNA. With a better knowledge of expanded forest sector national income accounting capabilities, attention is given to their potential uses in forest sector policy analysis. The report has two intended audiences. First, we address policy analysts and policy makers with expertise in the forestry sector of an economy. Second, we address national income accountants and applied economists who may work at adopting or using satellite accounts. The objective of the introductory chapter is to establish the contemporary context for utilizing satellite accounts for the forest sector. What problems can they be expected to solve? The second chapter reviews forest accounting in the 1993 SNA as a basis for introducing the satellite accounting information presented in Chapter.
Chapter 4 reviews a broad set of case studies, forest sector accounting trials and policy studies that utilize forest sector account information. Here are examined patterns of use, approaches to valuation, potential problems and limitations in the use of this important policy information system. Finally, action steps to improve the status and use of this evolving information system are discussed. 1.3 Challenges and Issues in the Forest Policy Dialogue.
There are a number of challenges to national income accounting which emanate from the environmental dialogue surrounding contemporary forest management issues. It is important to enumerate these issues before looking at specific ways to adapt and utilize the SNA in meeting these analytical challenges. A list of major forest policy challenges would certainly include the following. 1.3.1 An Expanded Accounting of Forestry Benefits.
The problem of forestry is well summarized by Vincent and Hardwick (1997). Forestry is an example of an activity whose contribution to the economy in a welfare sense is unlikely to be measured well by value added in the production account. Forests contribute directly to welfare through the provision of amenity values, which may not satisfy the SNAs' definition of.
The World Bank has been undertaken important work in recent years to both expand the definition of a nations wealth and to undertake new analytical approaches in evaluating sustainable development. See for example: Serageldin (1993) and World Bank (1997). The changes in SNAs and introduction of SEEA has been referred to by Hamilton and Lutz (1996) as the "greening" of macroeconomic analysis. It is not clear that this kind of labeling will increase or decrease the wood production from forests since the green benefits may work in contradictory directions.
3 `production'. They also provide other industries with services such as watershed protection, whose value the SNA records as part of the operating surplus of the recipient industries instead of as services furnished by forests. For these reasons, the SNA likely understates the economic contribution of forests. In summary, an overarching challenge is to use macroeconomic policy analysis models that reflect the genuine contribution of the forest sector to national well being. 1.3.2 Assessing the Sustainability of Forest Management.
The importance of sustainability was recognized at the Eleventh World Forestry Congress in a call for the development of forest survey capacities in the poorer countries (Lanly, 1997). Without proper survey data and associated environmental monitoring programs, much of the level of harvesting may be unsustainable either from the view of sustainable timber yields or.6 from a more conservation-based perspective of sustainable forest ecosystem management. Because forests may be managed sustainably, it should be possible to examine rates of accumulation and depletion as a direct indication of sustainability. This would mean that current rates of net accumulation (depletion) would be reported relative to long term rates of sustainable use.5 Of course, this implies that any wealth accruals associated with high and unsustainable levels of harvesting are potentially short-term in nature with the heightened likelihood that a nation could fall back into a low-income development situation as its forests become depleted. The usual view of the SNA is that it is not particularly well-suited to identifying problems of resource depletion and sustainability and thus, the second challenge is to adapt national income accounting procedures which will readily allow analysts to identify these kinds of problems. 1.3.3 Evaluating Deforestation and Changes in Land Use.
Another important issue is how to include deforestation and associated land use changes in forest sector national income accounts. Irrespective of whether the land is a commercial asset or not, there are typically many important environmental aspects associated with deforestation. Associated with deforestation is the issue of identifying land use changes and sustainability indicators. Therefore, another challenge to national income accounting principles is to identify and keep track of timber harvesting and potentially related problems of deforestation, desertification and land use changes as they occur. The purpose is to identify these problems in their infancy rather than to delay identification until a time when forest land and timber liquidation is essentially irreversible. This kind of national income statistics can lead to policy decisions which are more stable both from the standpoint of ecosystem phenomenon and wood using industries. 1.3.4 Evaluating Forest Degradation.
The quality of forests throughout the world appears to be subject to an increasing number of environmental stresses. These stresses may result from inappropriate management or from activities that originate outside forests. Another important challenge is to develop indicators of forest degradation that can be included in national accounts. The purpose of these.
The approach to wealth and sustainable development taken by the world bank is as follows. A nations wealth is the sum of its produced physical capital stock, its natural capital, its human capital and its social capital. Sustainable development is the accumulation of all capital. It is possible to accumulate total capital while depleting capital in one of the components. See Dixon and Hamilton (1996) and World Bank (1997).
4 indicators is to better report changes in forest quality due to exogenous and endogenous stresses. 1.3.5 Accounting for Non Market Forest Amenity Values.
Numerous approaches have been developed and used to estimate nonmarket values. The development and application of these concepts is extremely important because forest ecosystems comprise a broad array of nonmarket and market phenomena. The challenge is to utilize nonmarket values in the forest sector, which are estimated in the macroeconomic or general equilibrium context of analysis. The values must be consistent and comparable with market values in the larger system of accounts so that the forest sector is truly integrated into the larger economic system. Often nonmarket values are estimates of consumer's surplus for nonmarket goods and services. It must be kept in mind that prices for market goods are treated as parameters in the policy analysis. If this were not the case, consumer's surplus would also be included in the value of market goods and services as well. Thus, one important issue to resolve is how to estimate values. 1.3.6 Adjusting National Income for Household Consumption of Nonmarket Forest Products.
In many economies, there are significant levels of household consumption of non-timber forest products. One of the most important and best known examples is the gathering of fuelwood. In some economies fuelwood is the most important source of domestic energy and excessive levels of fuelwood collection and use may not be sustainable. The fact that fuelwood production and consumption activities are not market transactions means that the value of these activities are not recorded in national income accounts and actual levels of fuelwood production are often unknown. Again, since household consumption of products such as fuelwood is not known, policy makers can not easily evaluate the importance of these kinds of activities. Fuelwood is but one of these kinds of forest products that are important to households and which are not recorded in the transactions of an economy. In spite of the nature of these forest uses, it is important that they be recognized as a component of social wealth so that appropriate decisions may be made about the production and allocation. Thus the challenge is how to estimate the value and sustainability of forest products which are consumed directly by households. 1.4 Policy Uses of Forest Sector National Income Accounts.
Of course it is truly impossible to imagine the total number of different kinds of policy analyses made possible by an integrated set of Forest Sector SNAs and SEEAs. The following list represents a starting point and resulted from both brainstorming and from examining a list developed by Hamilton and Lutz (1996). In summary form, we suggest the following possible uses. 1.4.1 Improved Monitoring of the Forestry Sector Performance.
Because savings and investments play a very important role in developing countries, approaches to gauging the economic performance of an economy that ignore the depletion or accumulation of natural capital can yield very erroneous insights into the functioning of the economy. Developing national accounts for natural resource assets inclusive of their quality, quantity, rates of use and net investment can be a most important step in examining.
5 sustainable development where sustainable development is simply defined as the continued accumulation of all forms of wealth. 1.4.2 Accounting for Total Forest Production in National Economic Aggregates.
Given the discussion of the production relationships between the forest sector and other related sectors (agroforestry, hydropower, fisheries, and manufacturing), developing appropriate production relationships between the forest sector and the related sectors will help create far better insights into how the management of forests contributes to total economic well-being. Examining budgets for forest activities or examining the effects of macroeconomic or trade policies on the forest and related sectors are two extremely important ways that the green SEEA can be effectively utilized. 1.4.3 Accounting for Management Costs and Habitat Protection Costs.
Establishing habitat protection zones or bioreserves is an important element of sustainable development. In some important respects these kinds of decisions represent decisions to reallocate wealth between important sectors of the economy. In other words, because capital can be somewhat fluid, these decisions imply the substitution of one form of wealth for another with aggregate income and distribution effects. Examining these kinds of decisions is an important potential use of forest sector specific SEEA. 1.4.4 Monitoring the Relationship between Forest Sector Activities and Pollutant Flows.
By establishing the appropriate links between forest sector activities in input/output tables with other sectors, physical waste flows may be traced as pollution flows to other industries and activities. Beyond this, pollution reduction policies such as emissions regulations and pollution taxes can be evaluated and monitored. 1.4.5 Assessing the Effectiveness of Government Policies such as Taxes and Subsidies on the Forest Sector.
Many new policies, which are designed to maintain or improve environmental quality, will be considered in the future. The development of a forest sector SEEA should allow better capacities to evaluate the effectiveness of these kinds of policies. 1.4.6 Monitoring the effectiveness of broad macroeconomic policies of such as trade policies on the forestry sector.
Many broad economic policy instruments have differential effects on particular sectors of an economy. Development of a forest sector satellite account (SEEA) should allow more precise analysis of these kinds of policy instruments on the sustainable development. 1.4.7 Monitoring the Implementation of International Treaties.
Many international environmental issues will be solved through international treaties which could influence forest land use, or timber harvesting by the establishment of such agenda.
6 items as carbon sink requirements, special habitat areas or related approaches. A forest specific SEEA would help in monitoring these treaties 1.4.8 Land Uses.
Because of the concern with deforestation, desertification and land depletion, a critical policy issue well suited to a forest sector specific SEEA is the examination of genuine savings and depletion in the nations land account. While, land of course is fixed in it physical proportions, the productivity of land can be enhanced or degraded by human activities. Furthermore, some forest practices may ultimately lead essentially to the abandonment of potentially valuable forest land assets. By developing different land use accounts, a nation can keep track of the sustainability of its forests by keeping track of its land uses. In addition, the nation will also help track long term biodiversity implications. 1.4.9 Biodiversity Trends.
There are a number of ways to examine asset depletion in a nation's wealth of flora and fauna. Broad trends in depletion are indicated by rates of change in the number of extinct species. Perhaps more importantly from the standpoint of the forestry sector is need to identify spatially important areas of exceptional species richness and then monitor maintenance of this richness. 1.5 Forests and Broad Economic Values.
Forests are multiple-value resources. It is important to examine forest values in a broad way so that national income accounts and related satellite accounts may be more clearly understood. In order to make certain that the multiple resources of forests are valued consistently and comparably some of the broad values may be excluded from satellite accounts. That means that some analyses may be conducted with incomplete information6. Several authors have proposed a scheme for valuing total forest benefits. Kengen (1997), Gregersen, et al. (1995, 1997), and Kumari (1995) all draw from the work done by Pearce (1993, 1990). Total economic value consists of the sum of five kinds of values: direct use value, indirect use values, option values, existence values or quasi-option values. Because forest management has consistently and traditionally examined the direct use values, other values are often ignored7. Direct uses of the forest are ones in which there are specific consumers of forest goods and services. These consumers may or may not pay market-clearing prices for the rights to use these forest goods and services. These users could be recreation users, timber.
We quote a footnote from UN (Undated). "Contingent valuation, for instance, faces free rider attitudes, short-sightedness or ignorance of consumers about long-term environmental impacts, and effects of income levels and distribution when questioning individuals (in opinion surveys) about their preferences for environmental quality and related social values. Also, contingent valuation is inconsistent with the predominant national accounts application of market prices, since it includes consumers surplus [emphasis ours] which is appropriate for welfare measurement but incorrect in recording national accounts transactions." Of course many of the same information problems apply when a person buys a gallon of gasoline. We agree about problems of consumers surplus for the value of "fixed sites". There are methods for evaluating the change in consumers surplus reported in Bowes and Krutilla (1989). There is of course consumers surplus issues when one examines outputs at the economy level where output changes correspond with price changes with market goods and services. FAO, 1997. State of the World Forests.
7 purchasers, water users who either benefit or suffer from forest management activities, or economic agents who graze domestic stock on forest land. Indirect uses of the forest essentially occur because of the broad nonspecific environmental services provided by forests. For example, carbon uptake and storage helps reduce the deleterious impacts of global climate change brought on by massive fossil fuel consumption in the industrialized economies. At the current time, these services are nonspecific to any particular people or nation. Other important environmental services provided by forests include broad maintenance and stabilization of the earth's water and nutrient cycles as well as providing areas which collect, filter, and otherwise store toxic pollutants. Option values have been increasingly recognized as being important to protecting forest dependent life forms. Even if there is no known direct or indirect use value of various life forms, people recognize that some unknown use value may arise so that a value for potential uses may be important. Option values are more common than many people may first recognize. For example, citizens may be willing to pay a tax to keep bus service to their neighborhood in spite of typically using an automobile for primary transportation. Paying to keep bus service protects option to use buses that aren't expressed in the usual transactions based demand analysis. Bequest values are related to option values but add an element of intergenerational concern. Recognizing that actions of one generation may close options for future generations, a bequest value represents the willingness to pay to provide and maintain options for future generations that aren't able to express their values in current markets or political arenas. Existence values are the values people place on forests regardless of use. These values may be placed simply on forest landscapes or on forest-dependent species. For example, people may be willing to 1) support political agenda to maintain forests, and/or; 2) join groups to support those kinds of agenda, and/or 3) pay to protect forests or forest dependent species. In any case the three examples represent forms of resource allocation to secure the existence of something of value. Table 1.

The components of total economic value are used to classify major classes of forest goods and services in Table 1 above. Unlike Gregersen, et al. (1995, 1997), Pearce (1990) or Kumari (1995), we have made some double entries in the table to more adequately indicate some of the complexities in accounting for forest sector benefits. For example, water products are entered as direct benefits while watershed protection is seen as an indirect benefit. While this may at first be confusing, it is possible to influence the level, timing and.
This was essentially taken from Pearce (1990 and was reported and utilized in Kumari (1995). Unlike those sources, water products and grazing were added as a direct uses. Biodiversity was added as an indirect uses since some of the strongest arguments for maintaining biodiversity are to maintain system stability and that can be seen as a form of indirect use.
8 quality of water products in a basin (direct benefits), while at the same time contributing in some less known way to the likelihood and damage levels of floods (Flood prevention is an indirect service)9. Likewise biodiversity is a double-entry forest good and service. Maintaining biodiversity to maintain a stable ecosystem can be seen as an indirect benefit of forest management. The fact that people may be willing to pay simply to know that wild forests exist is an existence value of forests. There have been many studies designed to develop both the theory and practice of valuation for the kinds of forest values listed in Table.
We will briefly allude to some of the problems. and complexities of value estimation. Some of the direct use values have actual cash prices. Of these, a subset might be considered as competitive prices. Prices for much of the timber logged around the world is paid for under negotiated rates rather than through the competitive play of market forces. Furthermore, where common access exists for timber or other scarce forest resources, there is by definition, no price. In the case of unpriced resources, two kinds of outcomes pertinent to environmental accounting in the forestry sector can occur. In one case, the unpriced resource is combined with other factors of production and then sold. In the other case, the resource is not sold at all10. Both of these problems in valuation have severe microeconomic implications, as well, because in neither instance is the forest management organization compensated for the value of its products and as a result the incentive structure for efficient management is deficient. The remaining values in Table 1 are nonmarket in nature. Kengen (1997) summarizes many of the valuation techniques for the various kinds of market and nonmarket forest benefits. From a practical point of view, it is doubtful that all of the total forest values will be entered into forestry sector satellite accounts. There are a variety of reasons for this. Option values, bequest values and existence values pertain to virtually all of the goods and services produced in an economy and are not included in transaction values which are the standard fare values making up revenue flows in the economy. Thus for reasons of comparability, it would make little or no sense to add these three kinds of values to forestry sector activities while not adding them to the values in other sectors of the economy. It would make even less sense to add these values to only certain elements of the forestry sector while leaving them out of other sectors. For example, wood quality of some forms of old growth timber is essentially irreplaceable. High quality stringed musical instruments are made from slow growing high elevation old-growth Englemann Spruce trees11. One would expect that there are option values, bequest values and existence values that are not reflected in the stumpage prices for old-growth spruce timber. In summary, it is important that values for the various forest benefits examined in forest sector satellite accounts are comparable. In making a decision for comparability, some values will be excluded. This means that the analyst should carefully examine analytical results to be assured that left-out values won't "upset" the results of the policy analysis.
Satterlund, D. R. And P. W. Adams. 1992. Wildland Watershed Management. 2nd. Ed. Wiley and Sons. Provides the context for viewing water as a forest product. The United Nations Statistics Division recognizes both of these problems (UN, undated). They refer to correcting these problems as "adjusting the national accounts", and see the development of satellite accounts as helping enormously in this regard. Stumpage values reflect cutting rights with a limited contract duration. Rights to buy and hold timber are not sold as "stumpage". Typically if one wanted to hold quality "old growth" timber, one would have to buy site rental services as well as timber cutting rights. Futures markets for standing timber are unheard of. There have been limited futures markets for lumber and plywood in the United States. The future price trade dates do not extend for more than a year.
9 1.6 Linkages to Other Economic Sectors.
The system for classifying forest values in Table 1 is also useful for broadly examining economic activities and the interaction within subsectors of forest accounts and between broader economic sectors. When people consume final economic goods and services, their actions represent a final step in many connected activities that take place in making the good available for consumption. Production activities often span many sectors of an economy and the activities that take place between sectors are called linkages. Linkages are very important in several ways. If linkages are not well defined for the forest sector, then the impacts of changes in outputs of forest sector activities on regional or national aggregates will not be properly quantified and the development role of the sector will likely be understated. Table 2.

Forward linkages represent forest sector goods and services that either become factors of production for other intermediate and/or final goods and services. Backward linkages represent purchases of goods and services that are utilized in the production of the forest goods in question. These linkages are viewed as flows between sectors of an economy. Table 2 summarizes some key expected linkages in forest sector activities. The term expected is an important one because many of the linkages are not often easily discerned. Based on experience in Finland, Simula (1997) recommends that a cluster analysis be done to more carefully quantify linkages. The entries for Table 2 are limited to the direct uses in Table 1 because the direct use linkages are better understood than the indirect ones. It may be possible to model residual flows in an economy. If that is the case, then such factors as pollution flows between economic sectors may also be included in the table as well. This leaves the door open to including indirect use values. Options values, bequest values and existence values and their respective "activity levels" present more serious analytical difficulties. SNA is a report for a reference period such as a year. If there is in fact no option, bequest or existence activity for an environmental resource in the reference period, and no money has been exchanged it appears impossible to make a national income account entry for these values. Furthermore, there could in principle be option, bequest, or existence values for market as well as nonmarket goods. Since these values are typically excluded from exchange values in market goods, it would be prudent to totally exclude them to make values comparable. While some important valuation concepts may be left out of income accounts for reasons of comparability, it is also important to recognize that the measures of many important forest ecosystem components is also often highly imprecise. For instance, there are no doubt,.
Final goods and service such as recreational uses of land or land for residential uses has no forward linkages.
10 important and as yet undiscovered biochemical compounds linked with the indefinable and indescribable gene pools of the world's forests. In lieu of actual inventories of all life forms, Canada (1997) has developed a complex and detailed set of Criteria and Indicators (C & I). The process of developing C&I was launched by the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers, an extremely important step since the provinces control the vast majority of the commercially important forest lands in Canada13. Before leaving the discussion of linkages, it is important to mention one other problem associated with forest sector accounting. One of the most common uses of forest sector income accounts is to study and evaluate the impacts of policies on employment. Traditionally, the employment activity analysis has focused on both forest activities (forestry, logging and related service activities) and wood processing sectors (pulp and paper, lumber, panel products, and roundwood products). Poschen (1997) reports that on a global basis, total forest employment far exceeds recorded employment. The traditional definition of employment as participation in the paid labour market is not really adequate for capturing the reality of most persons for whom forests are the main source of livelihood. For the majority of these persons, the distinction between wage employment, self-employment and work for subsistence production is not meaningful. There are different ways of making a living that are often interchangeable. The same person may harvest wood for fuel for home consumption, make simple wood furniture for sale as a self-employed and work as a daily wage labourer planting trees.... While the problem of invisible forest sector employment is now being documented, just what to do about it in the sense of employment analyses, is far less clear at this time. 1.7 Sustainability and Satellite Accounts.
The term, sustainability has at least three relevant and important meanings in the context of forestry. Traditionally, the term meant perpetuation of timber supplies. In recent years, the focus has turned to sustainable forestry, sustainable ecosystem management and sustainable development. These changes in what is to be sustained reveal a broader forest management focus toward many uses and values as opposed to dominant timber production. The changes reflect growing concerns with avoiding environmental and social irreversibilities. While these different approaches to what is to be sustained may seem to be in conflict with each other, we shall see that forest sector satellite accounts, if constructed wisely, may be helpful to proponents of any of the various sustainability schools of thought.
The Council consisted of a forest minister from each of the nine provinces, a minister from each of the two territories along with the Minister of Natural Resources Canada. Canada is important in another respect since the country ranks third among countries in terms of the total forest land base.
Forest Resources in National Accounting.
A proper system of economic accounts for forestry should provide policy-makers with information that gives a more complete picture of the net benefits derived from forests than is the case at present. Such information should include wood as well as non-wood products; goods as well as services or functions; and benefits from marketed as well as non-marketed goods and services. While developing the system it may be kept in mind that a clear boundary line between forestry practices and agricultural or horticultural practices, although essential for developing an accounting framework, remains very difficult in actual practice. A lot more depends on data collection systems in specific countries. However, while developing the system, a clear mission should be that the total value of forests includes agro and social forestry values, which should be adequately credited to the forest sector. This will produce a far more comprehensive perspective for taking account of varying practices followed in different countries. The starting point for a forest sector SEEA is the treatment of forest activities in SNA. Without a firm understanding of how forests are treated in the broader accounting aggregates of SNA, it is truly impossible to develop a reliable forest sector SEEA. This understanding is founded in the physical and monetized stocks and flows for forest activities in SNA. The purpose of this chapter is to outline what information is already included in the conventional SNA and how it may be interpreted in terms of policy making. Furthermore, it is important to review the information on SNA to better understand how to integrate economic and environmental accounts into SNA. Discussion of the integration of satellite accounts is postponed until the next chapter. 2.2 SNA and Forestry Sector Accounts.
The SNA includes both flows of goods and services and stocks of assets used in the production of goods and services. The objective of the national accounts is not only to measure the flows of goods and goods and services resulting from capital investment and consumption (GDP and NDP) but also the accumulation/depletion of capital stock including natural capital. By utilizing ISIC (industry codes) and CPC (product codes) the rows and columns of Table 3 can be used to identify the different products produced by various industries and the uses of these products in final consumption. The asset accounts for economic produced and non-produced assets (see box 1 for SNA classifications of assets) are also compiled by industry (ISIC) and describe the stocks at the beginning and end of the accounting period and all changes therein.

Box 1 Classification of Assets in the SNA.
Economic assets are assets owned by institutional units from which economic benefits are derived by their owner(s) by holding them, using them over a period of time or selling them. Economic benefits recognized by SNA are incomes derived from production; holding gains; and receipts from the sale of assets. Economic assets may be produced or non-produced. Produced assets are those assets that come into existence as a result of a production process. Non-produced assets consist of assets that are needed for production but have not been produced. No input has been used in their creation. Economic assets can also be classified as fixed assets, valuables and inventories. Fixed assets are only those produced assets that are used repeatedly, or continuously, in processes of production for more than one year. Inventories consist of output produced by an enterprise, but not yet finished (work-in-progress) and stocks of product intended to be used for intermediate consumption or resale without further processing.
It is possible to use the supply and use table to identify forest sector components of value. In other words, it is possible to identify sector output, intermediate consumption, compensation of employees, taxes and subsidies. The forest sector includes timber, logging, growing of standing timber in plantations (produced assets)14 forestry and logging services activities, gathering of wild growing forest materials, such as cork, resins, lichens, etc. Note that gathering of mushrooms, berries and fuelwood, for sale and own-consumption is considered as output of the agriculture industry, not the timber industry. In chapter 3, we will discuss.
Timber growth in natural (uncultivated) forests is not treated as a process of production and therefore is excluded. It is instead as treated as other changes in assets.
13 disaggregation of activities related to forests but included in other industries (i.e. agriculture, mining, etc.). The asset accounts for produced assets include the stock of man-made capital at the beginning and end of the reference period and all changes therein. The stock of produced capital for the forestry industry consists of machinery used for planting, thinning and transporting logs and the value of the stock of timber in plantations. Changes in stocks include capital formation, consumption of fixed capital and other changes in volume of assets and revaluation. Capital formation includes the investments made by the forestry industry in machinery as well as all costs of reforestation and afforestation of produced and a nonproduced forests15 and natural growth of forest16. Other changes in volume include reductions and additions to the volume of the stock caused by economic decisions (i.e. changes in classification of timber from non-produced to produced asset), or natural causes (i.e. forest fires, diseases, etc.) or other causes. Reevaluation includes changes in prices of the assets. For timber stocks the change is usually calculated as a balancing item and therefore might include statistical discrepancies as well. Non-produced assets include land and natural "economic" forests or forests that are likely to be exploited. However, it is difficult to identify forest land in the SNA, as no explicit reference is made to land cover in the land classification. With regard to non-cultivated forests, the asset accounts include the value of the stock of forest at the beginning and end of the accounting period and all changes therein. The major difference between the asset accounts for cultivated and non-cultivated forests is revealed by the different ways that natural growth is reported. In the case of cultivated forests, natural growth is considered a process of production and it is, therefore treated as output, in the production accounts, and capital formation, in the capital account of the forestry industry. For non-cultivated forests, natural growth is considered as a result of a natural process and therefore recorded in the other changes in volume accounts, outside the production accounts. In practice, it might be difficult to distinguish cultivated from non-cultivated forests, because there is typically degrees of human intervention in either. instance. The question is how much input is needed to classify the forest as produced or non-produced? 2.3 Forest Production in SNA.
According to SNA, "certain natural processes may or may not be counted as production depending upon the circumstances in which they occur. A necessary condition for an activity to be treated as productive is that it must be carried out under the instigation, control and responsibility of some institutional unit that exercises ownership rights over whatever is produced." Thus, it should be noted that the growth of crops, trees, or livestock that is organized, managed and controlled by institutional units constitutes a process of production in an economic sense. Growth is not to be construed as a purely natural process, which lies outside the production boundary. However, an accounting decision must be made concerning those forests, which are not under economic use in order to clarify what portion of total forest growth is "produced". The measurement of forest output is complicated by the fact that the process of production may extend over many years. Thus standing timber has to be treated as work-in-progress -that is, as output which is not yet sufficiently processed to be in a form which is ready to be.
It has been argued that tree planting is not sufficient to create a forest classified as "produced" if there are no other tending activities. In cultivated (economic) forests, natural growth is considered as work-in-progress. It is included in inventories as a part of capital accumulation.
14 marketed. When trees are felled, the process of production is completed and the work-inprogress is transformed into inventories of finished products ready for sale or other use. Conceptually, therefore, timber production can be measured in exactly the same way as other types of production that require long production periods. Output should be recorded as being produced continuously over the entire period of production and not simply at the moment of time when the process is completed. In actual forest activities, output of natural and plantation forests may include all the related commodities and amenities such as food, fuel, fodder, shelter, fibre, medicines and recreation. These products and activities may be monetized but are also reported in physical terms such as the number of hectares of forests or volume of standing timber. Also included in the idea of forest activities are royalties collected, taxes, the expenditure incurred on maintenance and research, and changes in aggregates such as the rates of deforestation. This broad idea of forests and forest activities is far more inclusive than the traditional SNA forest production account. Thus standard production accounts may not meet the need of policy-makers. The SEAFA (system of economic accounting for agriculture), therefore, recommends accounts for the forestry sector as a whole as well as activity accounts for different forests classified according to their management aspects. The goods and services account is compiled only for the products of forestry as a whole and, the capital account in the system is intended to cover the forestry sector as a whole. 2.3.1 Asset Boundaries, Produced and Non-produced Forest Assets.
The SNA distinguishes between produced (human-made) and non-produced (natural) assets. Based on SNA terminology, all produced assets are "economic" and are included in the economic accounting system. A qualification is made regarding non-produced assets which is made clear from the quotation below. Effective ownership is the requirement for a natural resource to be included as an economic asset and not the fact that economic benefits might be derived from the asset. For example, open access high seas fisheries are an economic asset if there is the potential for a nation to claim and enforce exclusive access rights. This point is further highlighted in SNA 1.26 in reference to defining the asset boundary:.
"Balance sheets are compiled for institutional units, or sectors, and record the values of the assets they own or the liabilities they have incurred. Assets as defined in the System are entities that must be owned by some unit, or units, and from which economic benefits are derived by their owner(s) by holding or using them over a period of time. Financial assets and fixed assets, such as machinery, equipment and structures which have themselves been produced as outputs in the past, are clearly covered by this definition. However, the ownership criterion is important for determining which naturally occurring-i.e. Non-produced assets are included in the System. Naturally occurring assets such as land, mineral deposits, fuel reserves, uncultivated forests or other vegetation and wild animals are included in the balance sheets provided that institutional units are exercising effective ownership rights over them--that is, are actually in a position to be able to benefit from them. Assets need not be privately owned and could be owned by government units exercising ownership rights on behalf of entire communities. Thus, many environmental assets are included within the System. Assets that are not included are those such as the atmosphere or open seas, over which no ownership rights can be exercised, or mineral or fuel deposits that have not been discovered or that are unworkable--i.e. incapable of bringing any benefits to their owners, given the technology and relative prices existing at the time.".
15 2.3.2 Other Changes in the Volume of Assets Account.
2.3.2.1 Economic appearance of non-produced assets (transfers of other natural assets to economic activity) Economic assets are entities over which ownership rights are enforced by institutional units and from which economic benefits may be derived by their owners. Naturally occurring resources that qualify as economic assets are those that are under the direct control, responsibility and management of institutional units. Economic appearance occurs when an asset becomes classified as economic. For other natural assets, the first substantial market appearance, generally involving commercial exploitation, is the reference point for recording in this account. For virgin forests, gathering firewood is not commercial exploitation, but large-scale harvesting of a virgin forest for timber is, and brings the forest into the asset boundary. 2.3.2.2 Natural growth of non-cultivated biological resources The natural growth of non-cultivated biological resources -- natural forests, fishstocks, etc. -may take various forms. A stand of natural timber may grow, or fish in the estuaries may become more numerous. Although these resources are economic assets, growth of this kind is not under the direct control, responsibility and management of an institutional unit and thus is not production. The increment in the asset must then be regarded as an economic appearance, and it is recorded in the other changes in the volume of assets account. In principle, natural growth should be recorded gross, and the depletion of these resources should be recorded as an economic disappearance. This recording would be consistent with the separate recording of acquisitions and disposals described in the capital account. In practice, however, many countries will record natural growth net because the physical measures that are likely to be the only basis available for the recording are, in effect, net measures. These measures may be used in conjunction with a market price for a unit of the asset to estimate the value of the volume change to be recorded. 2.3.2.3 Other changes in the volume of assets account (Economic disappearance of nonproduced assets /Depletion of natural economic assets) The depletion of natural deposits covers the reduction in the value of deposits of subsoil assets as a result of the physical removal and using up of the assets. In principle, the depletion of natural forests and other non-cultivated biological resources included in the asset boundary as a result of harvesting, forest clearance, or other use should be included here. 2.4 Extension from SNA to SEEA.
Many methods have been put forward for including environmental accounting in the framework of national accounts. Such methods have different levels of consistency with the SNA. The SEEA supplements the SNA in the following ways. a) The SEEA separately identifies, in the supply-use table, activities related to the forests that not recorded in the SNA forestry industry and the associated expenditures related to.
16 forest protection and management. The SEEA, as a result, describes a far more realistic array of forest sector net benefits. b) The SEEA expands the asset accounts beyond "economic" (in the SNA sense of the term) to include "environmental" forests. All forests provide environmental services. Some of the forest are primarily used for economic purposes (i.e. timber and non-timber productions, etc.) and are labeled "economic". "Environmental forests", on the other hand, includes forests whose main function is providing environmental services. c) The SEEA introduces sectoral impacts, in physical and monetary terms, on natural (economic and environmental) forests caused by production and consumption activities of industries, households and the government in the production and asset accounts. This allows tracking of such phenomena as "acid rain". d) By linking physical accounts with monetary environmental accounts and balance sheets, the SEEA is an integrated extension of the SNA so there is accounting consistency. e) The SEEA may include elaborated environmentally adjusted indicators for deducting the costs of forest depletion or degradation from NDP and capital formation. As mentioned earlier, several non-timber products are recorded in industries different from the forestry industry. Activities related to the production of non-timber products in the forest can be separately identified to assess the contribution of forest to the economy. Expenditures by the forest industry are likely aimed at increasing or maintaining timber production. In most countries, the government is the prime actor in environmental protection, but industries and to a lesser extent households have been prompted more and more to respond directly to the environmental impacts they cause, according to the polluter/user pays principle. Also mentioned previously, asset accounts for produced and non-produced economic forests are already included in the SNA asset boundary. The SEEA also allows for the inclusion of "environmental" forests within its asset boundaries, to provide a better understanding of the national wealth and conservation of the forest. The lack of understanding about the details of ecosystems' functions makes the valuation of the "environmental" forests very controversial. The SEEA, therefore, focuses on the compilation of the asset accounts for "environmental". forests in physical terms only. Valuation of depletion and degradation of "environmental" forest is, however, possible through maintenance costing, that is the cost that would have been incurred if the environment had not been used to impair its future uses. Environmental impacts (depletion and degradation) on forests are valued and shifted to the production accounts, as opposed to the SNA that reports them in other changes in volume, outside the production accounts. Such costs are allocated to the industries and consumers causing the environmental depletion and degradation. Depletion and degradation caused by households is treated as cost of household production activities, identified as a separate industry in the SEEA17. Environmental degradation caused by government is recorded as cost of the government industry. In consistency with the conventional accounts, changes in environmental assets that cannot be attributed to production and consumption, such as natural disasters and natural growth, are recorded in "other changes in volume of assets".
Fuelwood, mushroom, and berry gathering are defined as agricultural production. If depletion results from overuse, costs should be subtracted from agricultural value added.
17 The costs of depletion and degradation of the forests can be regarded as consumption of natural capital. This suggests that asset use should be subtracted, along with the consumption of produced capital, from the gross value added of the pollution causing industry. This adjustment from GDP, and GFCF (gross fixed capital formation) would yield Environmentally-adjusted Net Value Added (EVA), Environmentally adjusted net Domestic Product (EDP) and Environmentally-adjusted net Capital Formation (ECF) figures. Calculations have also been made of the counterpart of ECF, "genuine" or net saving (World Bank 1995)18. Environmentally adjusted indicators would give more realistic information on the overall performance of the economy and its production and consumption patterns. Environmentally adjusted indicators are calculated on the basis of sustainability criteria. Only permanent losses of the income generating capacity of the forests from their uses are considered in the construction of environmentally adjusted indicators. Depletion of timber, for example, is defined as the part of logging that exceeds sustainable wealth accumulation. Each nation must develop a set of expectations about the acceptable rates of use in terms of long term wealth accumulation. This would set a boundary on rates of accumulation/depletion. Similarly, for forest asset degradation, emissions, which have negative wealth effects, are termed as unsustainable emissions. One point that should be noted is that monetary figures on depletion depend on two quantities: the physical quantity of the resource use, and the resource's market price. Market prices can change markedly from year to year, for reasons unrelated to physical scarcity. Therefore it is quite possible; when the physical use of a resource has gone up but its price has gone down, that the costs of depletion would be shown as decreasing despite the fact that more resource has been extracted. Similarly, degradation costs might be decreasing, despite increased emissions. This is due to reduced maintenance costs as a result of improved technology at lower costs. Physical data are an integral part of the accounts and should always be reported to avoid misinterpreting the results of the accounts. Another point that has been raised relates the inclusion of degradation costs in the production accounts. Conventional economists and national accountants argue that, contrary to depletion, where an allowance, for running down the resource stocks, is included in the business accounts, degradation costs have not been internalized. Maintenance costs can be seen as weights for the aggregation of the environmental impacts from the economy. This would provide an indication of which costs should have been internalized by the activity that caused. them (Bartelmus 1998). European countries have, instead, opted for aggregating the impacts in physical terms. Pollutants emitted are allocated to different environmental "themes", greenhouse gas, acidification, ozone layer depletion, eutrophication and waste. The allocation of the pollutants to the "themes" consists of a weighted average of the pollutants with weights proportional to the potential relative stress of each substance on the environment. A detailed breakdown of environmentally adjusted indicators by economic sectors may play an important role in policy making. These indicators could portray structural distortions of the economy from under-priced use of environmental resources and suggest initial estimates for the appropriate level of environmental cost internalization (i.e. taxes and subsidies, etc.) into the budgets of households and enterprises. Given the inefficiencies of command-and-control measures in environmental protection and natural resource conservation, the application of market instruments has been greatly advocated. Economic instruments are usually applied to those who can be held responsible for natural resource depletion and environmental degradation, according to the user/polluter-pays principle.
The difference between ECF and genuine saving is that the latter can be financed by foreign sources of capital finance. Both indicators are modified, in principle, by the same amount of environmental cost.
Because it is anticipated that some economic goods and activities, which have no observable price, may never the less be valued in the SEEA, it is important to use the valuation approach of SNA as a starting point. Direct impacts of economic activities on the environment are accounted for through market based valuation which relies on readily observable prices. An alternative valuation method, consistent with the SNA, which attempts to capture both direct and indirect impacts, is maintenance cost. Each valuation method yields an imputed cost of "protecting" the forest. Quality aspects which, could be a result of economic activities from previous accounting periods or from other countries within the same or previous periods are not directly valued. Aspects of environmental activities that affect the quality of the forests are often brought about by logging (loss of habitat for biodiversity, loss of watershed protection, etc.) or by airborne industrial and consumer emissions that cause acidification. Also, natural and man-caused forest fires, insect infestations, windstorms and/or plant diseases can bring about significant changes. Forest degradation is reflected in the SNA (in monetary terms) only in so far as it reflects direct impacts of economic activities or through maintenance cost valuation. In instances, where no market transaction is available, (e.g. household consumption of selfproduced goods) the convention applies to value these goods at the prices which would have been obtained in the market had the goods been sold. This is a straightforward valuation method. For example, the value of household collected and consumed wild fruit would be the market price of the same or highly similar products. 2.5.1 Imputed Environmental Costs.
The SEEA offers different concepts from SNA for the calculation of environmental costs. Its focus is on the cost-caused concept or the economic activity that causes the environmental cost. Applied to the use of forest resources, two categories of environmental costs are distinguished: depletion costs and degradation costs. Depletion costs refer to the quantitative depletion of the stock by the economic activity. Degradation of the resource, on the other hand, reflects the qualitative deterioration of the natural environment by the economic activity. SEEA proposes to estimate degradation costs either at the level of the causing economic activity or at the level of those industries and households that need to bear such costs. In the first case, imputed costs would show an estimate of the costs incurred in preventing or mitigating the deterioration and thus of maintaining the environment (i.e. maintenance cost valuation concept). In the second case, actual costs may be estimated by calculating the loss in production of the affected industries and, in the case of households, their `willingness to pay' for not bearing the degradation. Both the cost-caused and cost-borne concepts create conceptual and practical estimation difficulties. The cost caused approach may result in significantly underestimating the `real' welfare cost associated with environmental degradation because the prevention or mitigation costs could be much less than the costs borne. The cost borne concept, on the other hand, assumes that all productivity losses can be estimated into the future and assigned to a particular economic activity. Some of these losses may be borne by economic units other than those of the country where the degrading (or depleting) activity originates.
19 Household welfare losses due to environmental degradation are normally estimated using contingent valuation methods (willingness-to-pay approach). There are various problems associated with this valuation method including the observation that the stated willingness-topay may be higher than `true' willingness (free-rider problem) and the fact that the income of a person will place a constraint on her/his ability and, thus, willingness to pay. The latter is highly significant because poorer people are often in conditions where they need to shoulder the brunt of environmental degradation (e.g. location of slums in the most polluted, noisiest and disaster-prone areas).
Augmenting SNA Forest Sector Accounts with Satellite Accounts.
Having discussed the basic Forest Sector reports in a nation's standard SNA, the purpose of this chapter is to show how the SNA can be augmented and expanded by utilizing what are commonly referred to as satellite accounts. The purpose of developing these accounts is to better identify more detailed information, which is often obscured by the aggregate nature of the broad classification system utilized in SNA. After discussing the relationship between the SNA and the SEEA, specific features or capabilities of satellite accounts are presented and discussed. The features or capabilities include the following. · The capability to disaggregate and reformat national accounts related to forest activities in order to: 1) identify economic activities which represent inter-industry/inter-sectoral linkages; and 2) identify forest management expenditures for stand cultivation, forest protection and forest maintenance activities. These capabilities will ultimately allow policy analysts to use input/output models for forest sector policy analysis. The capability to develop specific accounts for: 1) forest land, 2) timber, and 3) carbon, to more readily allow examination of important issues such as sustainability and carbon sequestering. The capability to analyze the environmental effects of other industries on forests. The capability to examine the environmental effects of forest sector activities both on the forest sector itself as well as on other economic sectors. The Relationship Between SNA and SEEA.
One important distinction between SNA classifications and the potential classifications developed in satellite accounts comes from the basic idea of assets used in SNA. Only economic assets, i.e. assets owned by some entity or unit from which economic benefits are derived by their owner(s) by holding them, using them over a period of time, or by selling them, are within the asset definition or boundary of SNA. Economic benefits recognized by SNA are incomes (derived from production) and holding gains and receipts from the sale of assets. Thus, "noneconomic" forests are not included in SNA but may be included in a detailed satellite account. Noneconomic forests may include areas that are unprofitable to log, or lands that are protected with no commercial gains accruing to the owners. A second important element associated with the idea of economic assets is derived from that basic classification of assets being either produced or non-produced. Non-produced economic assets are those assets that are not the result of a production process, in the sense that no inputs have been used for their creation. SNA treats land as non-produced in all cases. Land may be cultivated or non-cultivated. In the case of forests, the term cultivated means that some work or capital has been used for producing the output grown on land. Products grown on cultivated forest land are generally treated as produced; products grown on non-cultivated land are treated as non-produced. The distinction of produced versus nonproduced products coming from cultivated versus non-cultivated forest lands utilized in the SNA/SEEA framework is analogous to the FAO approach of natural versus plantation forests. Another important facet of the SNA/SEEA relationship lies in asset classification. Assets may act as fixed assets, valuables or inventories. In SNA although all economic assets are.
22 expected (by definition) to produce economic benefits to their owners, they do not all act as "fixed" assets. Fixed assets are only those produced assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in production processes for more than one year. Because standing cultivated timber typically yields a product far less frequently than a year, it is classified as inventory (work in progress) rather than a fixed asset. These categorizations of forest assets are summarized as follows. Non produced Land Non-cultivated Cultivated Timber Grown on noncultivated land Produced Inventories of timber grown on cultivated land.
Rather clearly the SNA classification system must be adjusted in SEEA to better describe important forest values. If, for example, timber sequesters and stores carbon annually and this form of annual service takes place on noneconomic forest land as well as economic lands, these kinds of forest functions and values won't fit the SNA asset classification system and must be modified in the satellite account. In order to clarify the relationship between SNA and SEEA in the accumulation and balance sheet accounts, the following key forest sector items found in these account are examined. - - - - - - - - - - Opening and closing stocks Gross fixed capital formation Changes in inventories, which is the balance of natural growth and fellings for cultivated timber. Consumption of fixed capital Acquisitions less disposals of non produced assets Additions, i.e. natural growth for non-cultivated timber Depletion, i.e. fellings from non-cultivated timber Degradation of forest land due to acidification Catastrophic losses of timber (forests fires) Changes in classification and in particular changes from forests land to other land.
These key items are shown here in the structure of accumulation and balance sheets used in SNA. Again, it should be clear that these classifications are for economic assets so that further detailed accounting for noneconomic forest assets must be done in the SEEA. There are two complementary and interrelated descriptions of economic forest-related flows and stocks that are integrated into SNA forest sector accounts. - Current (production, distribution and use of income) accounts describe forestrelated economic transactions in terms of activity flows that generate products and incomes. - Balance sheets describe the stocks of assets at the beginning and the end of a reference period (typically a year). All of the changes that affect the opening value of stocks from the beginning to the end of the accounting period are Accumulation accounts and balance sheets describe forest-related assets in terms of described exhaustively in order to fully account for changes in asset values.
Structure of accumulation accounts with balance sheets.
Produced Fixed Inventories (cultivated timb) Non produced Forests land Cultivated Non-cultivated Timber Total.
Opening stocks Capital account Gross capital formation Changes in inventories Fixed capital Net acquisition of nonproduced assets Consumption of fixed capital Other changes in volume of assets account Additions (natural growth) Depletion (fellings) Degradation Catastrophic losses Other volume changes Changes in classifications Revaluation account Holding gains/losses Closing stocks.
Balance sheets are related with economic activity flows through the capital account. Coupling the activity flows with other changes that affect asset values such as "other changes in volume" or the "revaluation" accounts allows an exhaustive manner of relating how production, consumption, accumulation and depletion affect capital assets over time. Because these accounts concentrate on economic assets in SNA, the SEEA will allow a broader array and manner of integrating forest capital and activity flows. 3.3 3.3.1 Disaggregating and Reformatting National Accounts Linkages with ISIC.
According to the international standard industrial classification (ISIC), the forest industry consists of all units whose main activity is to grow timber in plantations, fell and harvest wood and other forest goods such as cork and gum etc. and produce services related to forest management, protection and maintenance. However, data may often be reported in such a way that actual forest activities are reported in other industries. For example, an integrated company with woodlands and sawmills or pulp mills may have some or all of its activities erroneously reported in the wrong industry. Therefore in order to identify all output related to forests and estimate the corresponding values it is necessary in a first stage to scan all relevant positions of the ISIC and identify all forests-related output produced as secondary activity. In national accounts, the output is deemed to cover all goods, including goods produced for own final use or those goods produced and consumed in the same sector. However, in many countries, limitations in data reporting imply that some output is unreported. Some of these. frequently acknowledged unreported forest sector activities are fuelwood, game meat, medicinal plants and other foodstuffs. The value of this output should be estimated and included in national account figures. The SNA recommends that output produced for own final use be valued at the average (basic) prices of the same goods (and services) sold on the market (provided they are sufficient quantities sold to enable reliable.
24 estimates). If there is unreliable product price data, goods for own consumption should be valued at the total cost of production per unit internally consumed. Because unpaid labour may account for a large part of the inputs, it is important to make some estimate of its value using wage rates paid for similar kinds of work in the local labor market. The output from forests as modified from SNA may be presented in a supply table such as the following. Table 5 Supply table for forests products.
Industries Output by product Natural growth (cultivated timber) Logs, pulp and fuel wood Other goods related to forest Cork, gum, etc. Agricultural goods Services incidental to forestry Other forest-related services Total forest related output.
Agriculture Forestry Other wood industries Public administration Other industries.
In addition to help identify all outputs in relation to forest, this table could be used to examine inter-industry/intersectoral linkages and their policy implications for sustainable forest management. In a second stage value added and all factors' incomes corresponding to the output must be assessed. In many cases, as inputs for secondary activities are not explicitly described, estimations are necessary. Table 6 Value added and incomes from forests.
Agriculture Forest related output Intermediate Consumption Gross value added Consumption of fixed capital Net value added Net taxes on production Compensation of employees Net oper.surp./mixed income Total forest related output Forestry Other wood industries Public administration Other industries.
As a complement of output and incomes assessment, and for sake of consistency, it is necessary to identify the uses of the output: intermediate or final consumption, capital formation, exports, etc. 3.3.2 Forest Land Account The purpose of the forest land account in the SEEA is to describe changes in land use in both physical and monetary terms. Since the SNA includes only economic forest land without explicit reference to forest cover, noneconomic forest land is added to the forest land satellite account. A matrix could be constructed in the satellite account to report both total land areas.
25 for items in the classification system as well as changes between classes when land is allocated from one use to another within the accounting period. The land classification used in SNA relies on the following broad categories - - - - Land underlying buildings and structures Land under cultivation, including land under plantations Recreational land, amenity land, parklands and pleasure grounds Other land not elsewhere classified.
Rather clearly, forest land and grazing land are indistinguishable in SNA so a satellite account may be developed to better enable policy-makers to keep track of these environmental/economic assets. SEEA reorients the SNA classification towards environmental concerns by distinguishing forest land as an item of economically used land. In order to describe all land, it also integrates non-economic land. Non-economic forest lands include lands withdrawn from commercial exploitation and land economically inaccessible for logging and development purposes. The following suggested forest land classification system integrates categories from SNA, SEEA, FAO and UN-ECE. Forest land (UN-ECE classification of land) - Economic forest land (forest land recorded in SNA balance sheets) Cultivated (plantations and semi natural forests in FAO classification) Non cultivated (natural forests and secondary forests in FAO classification) - - Non economic forest land Protected Non protected Other land (land underlying buildings... agricultural land, etc.). Several additional approaches for classifying land may be desirable. For example, lands designated as critical wildlife habitats or land classifications based upon cover or habitat types maybe of sufficient importance to include in satellite accounts. Likewise, classifications of forests based upon functions, health status or management regimes may also be included in a satellite account. Table 7 Changes in land use/cover: basic physical table.

Opening stocks Changes due to economic use or decisions Deforestation Afforestation Change in cultivation status Change from non economic to economic Protection and changes to non economic Non referable changes Natural colonization or regression Other non referable changes Closing stocks.
26 Because a forest land account is a form of fixed asset account, it includes an accounting of the changes between opening and closing land stocks. Balance sheet changes in land use (or cover) are (even if only partially, and/or indirectly) related to economic activities. These changes are recorded as occurring outside the production boundaries (other volume changes in SNA and other accumulations in SEEA). Areas affected during the period by catastrophic events (fires, windstorms, insect infestations, etc.) which do not modify the classification of land may be recorded as a "memoranda" item, and linked with timber balances. The above mentioned table allows for the description of the main changes that may affect forest areas: · Changes in area due to deforestation and afforestation, natural colonization or regression: are environmentally significant from many perspectives. For example, these changes can be linked in the SEEA to changes in biodiversity, carbon uptake and storage, or erosion. Changes in cultivation status may be linked to other SEEA accounts both in terms of changes in timber production as well as potential changes in biodiversity. Changes in economic status may occur when a remote natural forest initially considered as non-exploitable changes as a result of technological change, resource prices or infrastructure investments such as ports, rail accessibility or road developments. Conversely protection of a forest area may change its status to "non economic", if severe restriction are imposed. Decrease in prices may have the same effect.
The idea of economic appearance and disappearance of economic assets was discussed in section 2.3.2 of this report. A similar approach to the appearance/disappearance of noneconomic forest resources, which have environmental significance, could also be included in the SNA. This could be applied to the listing, delisting, recovery or extinction of species. It might also be important in the area of noneconomic lands as well. Similar tables may be drawn, in accordance with other environmental concerns. For example, balance sheets could be constructed for important forms of forest degradation indicating the area affected and changes in area from previous periods. Forest Land Valuation Under the SNA, the value of land is separated from the value of standing timber and the extension of the separation of asset values is a logical extension in forest sector satellite accounts. As a general rule, forest land is comparatively low in value relative to other land uses. This land value is derived from the capacity of land to produce crops of timber. Often forest land ownership caries with it the right to allocate land to other uses so that ownership may be seen as reflecting a variety of land use options which are also of value. Ideally, forest land values in SEEA are based on actual land transactions. However, forest land transactions often include land and standing timber in a transaction "package" so that values of the two assets must be separated for the different entries in the SEEA. If there is inadequate data to separate the asset values, SNA procedures recommend that the combined value be entered into the asset account for the highest valued asset. The value of cultivated forest land. This value may be estimated by utilizing yield productivity estimates coupled with management regimes, production costs and an optimal rotation age using the SNA indicated discount rate. Results should be compared whenever possible with actual land prices as well as with prices of marginal agricultural land. Value of non-cultivated forest land can in general be expected to be even lower than that of cultivated forest land. Growth in natural forests may also be low. The main value of nonEconomic and Environmental Accounting for Forestry: Status and Current Efforts.
27 cultivated land lies in the potential to change its use from non cultivated land under natural forests to another use (agriculture, including forestry or built-up land). Of course the possibility also exists to reclassify this kind of land as some form of protected land. The earlier discussion of forest asset balance sheets focused exclusively on physical estimates of land. The table below represents a monetized balance sheet for economic and noneconomic land. Table 8 Changes in land use/cover: basic monetary table.

Note that land is the only non-produced asset for which investments in the land are added to the value of the stock. In contrast, timber investments such as for reforestation is recorded as capital formation for the forest industry and hence is not added to the value of the timber stock. All changes in value are recorded in the column corresponding to the category of the land in the opening balance sheet. When land moves from one category to another during the period, the row "changes in classification" records the shift of values between categories. When forest land is deforested and the land is allocated to a higher value use, the increase in value is registered in the "deforestation" row. In this case, it could be argued that one has also to take into account the value of the decrease of carbon binding capacity (or loss of biodiversity, etc.). Present benefits (first the benefits from selling the timber, second the benefit from changing the use of the land, expressed by the higher value of the land) are exchanged against the future losses, including the decrease in the carbon binding capacity. The nature and the value of this additional item is however controversial. If the present value of the benefits were lower than the discounted value of future losses, it would be preferable not to deforest. If, however, discounted benefits were less than discounted costs, the balance would tilt toward deforestation. The issue is complicated by the choice of discount rates, problems in valuing nonmarket phenomenon and possible irreversibilities in biodiversity.
Forest Management/Protection/Maintenance Expenditures Account.
Before discussing satellite account entries for forest management expenditures, it should be useful to briefly examine the nature of forest uses and costs as they relate to various previously discussed classes of forest lands. Table 9 Forest Costs, Land Types and Activities Economic Forest Land Cultivated Non-cultivated Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Yes Yes Yes Yes Non-economic Forest Land No Yes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Sometimes Yes Yes.
Management Activity Timber Investment Forest Protection Inventory Grazing Management Wildlife Habitat Mgt. Recreational Mgt. Administration Exp Transportation Exp.
Very often a single forest management entity has both economic and noneconomic forest land. For example, even a timber corporation may own areas covered with water or rocks and ice in addition to cultivated and non-cultivated forest land. Furthermore, many public forest land agencies throughout the world manage their lands around the principle of multiple-use. Thus, for example, considerable time and effort often is devoted to producing high quality recreational experiences on public lands as well as the more commonly expected forest products. To some extent, the multiple uses are "joint products" (a sheep rancher produces meat and wool so that production costs may be allocated somewhat arbitrarily to more than one cost center). When economic and noneconomic forest lands are spatially intermingled, forest protection activities such as insect control or fire suppression have distinct neighborhood qualities. For example, failure to control a wilderness fire may mean that valuable nearby plantations or other nonforest assets are at risk. And while timber management invariably requires some means of transporting logs to mill sites, recreational lands also have transportation networks of roads and trials. Forest sector expenditures which have the purpose of securing expanded benefit flows typically include inventory, research efforts, biodiversity protection, fire protection, resource planning, transportation expenditures (construction and maintenance), facility construction and maintenance as well as the usual silvicultural expenditures. Costs of these activities are not included in the intermediate consumption of forest products and must be treated as additional intermediate consumption in order to calculate net value added. Table 10 Forest Management Expenditures and Net Value Added 500M$ 250M$ 40M$ 20M$ 5 M$ 185M$ 250M$.

29 The importance of these costs in terms of their role in calculating value added can be better seen by examining summary data from the Canadian Province of Ontario. If substantial amounts of the forest management expenditures in the above table are designed to secure favorable flows of nonwood forest products and services, then it would be prudent to allocate some of these costs to other forest product accounts. Recreational activities are indirectly included in the SNA as tourism expenditures. The question of which expenditures are considered as integral parts of recreational expenditures is very relevant19. Many studies have indicated that recreationists are willing to pay more for site access than they are frequently required to actually pay. Willingness to pay for the recreational experience has been estimated in countless cases. Several caveats are worthy of mention as a set of precautions in using willingness to pay estimates in satellite accounts. Willingness to pay is a formal way of estimating consumer surplus. There is also consumers surplus for market goods but the usual assumption of recreation value studies is that the impact on market goods prices and resulting consumers surplus when forgoing the production of market goods in allocating a site to nonmarket use is sufficiently small that it is negligible. SNA does not include consumer surplus for market goods and services. Rather, the price of the good or service does not change with the activity level. Since SNA is a macro or regional level of analysis, and one could analyze the level of production of recreation activities, it would appear that recreational values should be consistent with values in other sectors being analyzed. Thus, willingness to pay based on the consumer's surplus associated with a single fixed site may not be an appropriate value in a forest sector satellite account. 3.4 Timber Account.
Timber accounts are generally first drawn in terms of physical volume estimates such as cubic or board measures. They describe all timber, whatever the economic classification. An example of a simplified timber account is presented below (Spruce volume from Nordic natural resources accounting). It should be noted that all volume estimates are not estimates of biomass but rather are estimates of a useable portion of the wood stem. Each volume measurement has some assumptions about the minimum log length, stump height and minimum small-end diameter of the log. These merchantability standards can change over time so there may also be entries in timber accounts that capture changes in growing stock owing to changes in measurement standards. Table 11 Timber Account.
Timber (Mm , inc. bark).
Opening stocks + annual growth - fellings Of which net removal Of which silvicultural waste - natural losses Closing stocks Changes in stock.
The World Tourism Organization is working on developing satellite accounts which could be used for ecotourism.
30 This simplified account may be complemented by specific tables describing the uses of timber removed from forests as intermediate consumption by the various wood industries and as final. consumption (mainly fuel wood) by the households. Concerning the valuation of timber stocks and changes in stocks, two cases are to be theoretically distinguished: produced timber and non-produced timber. In valuing produced timber, two questions arise, how much is the standing timber worth and what is the value of the annual growth increment? The value of the annual growth or increment is estimated by distributing the value of the finished product (mature standing timber) in proportion to the costs incurred in each period. Added to the costs is a mark-up for the estimated operating surplus or mixed income? From a practical perspective, assumptions must be made concerning the future value of standing timber, at the time it will be felled as well as about the total costs which will be incurred throughout the life of the timber. Although present prices are used, this calculation is rather uncertain. Several methods have been employed to assist in this calculation. The simplest approach involves multiplying the stocks and flows in physical quantities by the stumpage price (see below). Based on the present value principle, this simplification assumes that as a first approximation the need for discounting future receipts is counterbalanced by the future growth of the timber. However, as shown by Vincent and Hartwick (1997), in most cases it is theoretically inconsistent and introduces a bias. It may be preferable to make explicit assumptions about the likely felling date and to discount the anticipated receipts. Valuing non-produced timber is somewhat different from valuing produced timber. Recall that growth of non-produced timber was not considered a product of management. As a result, it is unnecessary to estimate the value of the growth increment of timber on uncultivated forest lands. Were this not the case, the accounts would yield the false impression that timber investments were more productive on non-cultivated lands than on cultivated ones since growth would be acquired without any distributed cost outlay. Stocks can be valued either by multiplying volumes by stumpage prices or by calculating a present value with the same assumptions about future harvest dates, as is the case of fellings from cultivated lands. Depletion (the decrease in value due to fellings) is given by the value of the fellings; the change in the net present value of the stock of timber between the beginning and the end of the period, is given results from depletion and holding gains. In all cases the most important information to be collected is the value of fellings or stumpage price. In a surprising number of instances a competitively determined stumpage price is not available because markets are ruled by administered prices or because of other institutional arrangements which limit the generation of accurate stumpage value information. In instances such as these, stumpage must be calculated rather than collected. The residual value approach to appraisals may be useful in these instances because it estimates stumpage value by starting with the value of products produced and reduces this amount by the costs of converting standing timber into wood products. (A normal profit and risk margin is also normally subtracted from product values as well). The left over "residual" is the estimated value of timber. The process may be simplified somewhat if good roadside prices are available. Prices.have to be calculated or collected for the various species of wood. Corrections may be necessary in order to take into accounts exceptional events, such as tempests, fires etc, before arriving at a significant market price for standing timber, and hence the value of fellings. One must keep several things in mind when estimating the value of the entire economic timber stock. When using stumpage prices to estimating the value of timber stocks, there are normally substantial differences in the qualitative characteristics between mature timber being sold and growing timber that will be harvested in the future. Perhaps most clearly, mature timber is typically larger with fewer logs per unit of volume. The costs of logging.
31 typically are less per unit of volume for larger trees than for smaller ones since there are simply fewer pieces to handle. Also larger trees are typically manufactured into more valuable products than are smaller ones. Thus, if stumpage prices are used to value the entire economic stock, diameter adjustments can be used to avoid overstating the value. Jackson and McQuillan (1979) demonstrated how to do this with statistical appraisals. Logging costs can be adjusted in the residual value appraisal system for the number of logs per unit of volume logged. This in turn can be used to adjust the value of standing stocks to reflect broad qualitative differences from the typical timer being sold. 3.5 Carbon Account.
In this section we turn to an important example of integrating non-SNA items with basic SNA information in a forest sector satellite account. Forests provide socially important climate modification services by binding carbon released by other sectors in the economy. These services serve at least in part to curb global warming because carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Various studies show that young forests bind the most carbon but older forests store the most carbon. As forests mature, decay of stored carbon increases so that eventually some form of rough balance between carbon uptake and release eventually occurs. As an example, some authors consider see climax forests as carbon reservoirs but not necessarily net carbon sinks. Carbon balances for the stocks of trees are generally calculated on the basis of the forest balances or stocks and stock to carbon coefficients. An example using spruce inventory data from Nordic forests is presented below. The dry matter content of spruce is estimated in 387kg/m 3 wood. The carbon content in the dry matter has been estimated in 0.519. The volume of standing timber is converted to carbon content by using a conversion coefficient of 0.2 between cubic meter and tons of carbon. Table 12 Balance of carbon in Nordic countries (spruce).

Major uncertainties affect the description of carbon binding and storage. Carbon binding should not be reduced to a simple transformation of the standing timber stock since the amount of stored carbon is not a simple linear transformation of the standing stem volume. a) Standing volume is an estimate of the commercial product content of the standing tree and excludes small trees, branches, roots, or other forest plants that together with the decaying liter constitute the stored carbon.
32 b) There are carbon transfers between the over-ground forest biomass and the soil. A portion of the carbon bonded in above ground vegetation as well as roots become organic soil as plant parts die and decay. Carbon is stored in the soil for time periods. Various authors suggest that the share of carbon bonded in stem of the tree is no more than 15% of the total amount of carbon bonded within the entire ecosystem. The major part (73%) is bonded in the soil (at a depth from 0 to 30 cm). Table 13 Distribution in % of the Total Amount of Carbon Stored in Forests Ecosystems (from Nordic Natural Resource and Environmental Accounting)20 Stem timber Branches needles and leaves Roots ground vegetation Soil Total 15 4 1 6 1 73 100.
c) Finally some of the carbon bonded through forest growth stored in the forest ecosystem is removed when trees are felled and logs are removed from the forest. The longer the life of this wood and processed wood products, the bigger the carbon reserves they represent. The carbon is preserved best in sawn goods and building material for which the decomposition cycle is around 80 years. The carbon content in paper products and board is on average released within two years. Certain paper and board products will however, are kept for centuries, amongst other places in libraries and archives. As a conclusion, it is difficult to make an exact assessment of the annual net carbon binding by the forests and of the extent of changes in the overall reserve of carbon in forests and wood products. It is also difficult to give any reliable estimates of factors, which increase or decrease this carbon reserve. Valuing carbon-sequestering services presents some interesting challenges. The cost of abating or avoiding CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions which are the pollutants causing acidification damages of forests is estimated using end of pipe technology, or substitution costs. These costs should be deducted from the value added of the causing industry. Another approach values the future damages "avoided" through a net present value calculation. This method assumes that the impacts of temperature increases based on the emission of one supplementary ton of CO2 during the period are known, and that a value (a cost) can be attributed to them. It also assumes that a discount rate has been chosen. A comparison of three such costs computations has been performed by Nordhaus (1993). Should the carbon dioxide concentration double as it is expected to by the year 2030 (unless today's rate of increase slows) the average temperature on Earth is expected to rise 1-3° above today's level. Some studies calculate that climate change costs will rise to 1.0-1.3% of GDP annually. A corresponding value with this change in GDP for carbon is US$ 3.3/t CO2. In other words, carbon value through this method is approximately 10 US$/t carbon. This falls in the low end of the range of values found in the literature, namely from 5 to 125 US$ per ton of carbon emitted.
A joint report from the offices of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. March 1996. Eurostat.
33 In these conditions, the value of the sequestration by forests of a ton of carbon depends on the set of assumptions made regarding the physical effects of sequestration and their economic expression. Of significant importance are the rate of discount utilized, and the anticipated level of GDP in the future in a particular geographic areas. The estimated carbon sequestering.value of forests are therefore quite imprecise. However imprecision is not an excuse of failing to agree on an approach for estimation. 3.6 Environmental Impacts on Forests caused by Forest Activities.
Forests are multifunctional ecosystems. Several economic activities take place in the forest that have direct and indirect impacts on the ecosystem itself, as well as on human well being. Direct impacts are closely linked to the use of forests. Indirect impacts relate to qualitative aspects of forests, as providers of environmental services and amenities.

Direct Impacts.
Direct impacts are usually measured in physical and monetary terms. The valuation used, as mentioned earlier, is market based. Monetary values are obtained by multiplying the physical quantities by a per unit value. Direct impacts include the following items: Depletion/Accumulation of timber is defined as the changes in economic and non-economic stocks. Non-economic stocks are included because of, for example, illegal logging in protected forests. Furthermore, non-economic forests often continue to be used for nontimber products. The depletion can also be noted as exceeding sustainable harvests. This leaves the issue of "hard sustainability" to policy makers in each respective economy. Governments often estimate sustainable timber harvests on the basis of the regenerative capacity of the forest for timber production. Depletion caused by the above activities may constitute a significant part of the overall depletion and it should be estimated and its cost deducted from the value added of forestry and agriculture industries, respectively. Depletion/accumulation of non-timber products is harder to measure. Production of nontimber products is included in the production boundaries of the 1993 SNA (i.e. berries and wild mushroom constitute output of agriculture, peat production output of mining, game related products output of hunting)21. As mentioned earlier, depletion measures the loss of the income generating capacity of the resource. Conceptually, depletion of non-timber products should be measured both in physical and monetary terms and treated as consumption of natural capital, as it is the case of timber. In practice, however, data on stocks and as a result, sustainable yield are usually not available. In some areas of the world, there is a significant inverse relationship between timber stocks and hydrological runoff such that logging may augment hydropower production. This would be a separate fossil fuel offset since hydropower production does not require the burning of fossil fuels. Given the difficulties of certifying the sustainability of forest management operations, some countries are developing Criterion and Indicators (See Canada Council of Forest Ministers, 1997). These indicators can be included in the SEEA at least in terms of physical inventories and gains or losses. 3.6.2 Indirect Impacts.
Forest uses can cause ecological damage. Actual expenditures made to protect the forest and to rectify the damage are included in the SNA and can be separately identified to obtain an indication of the impact on the environment. In most countries, however, such expenditures may not be a good indicator of the changes in the market and non-market values of the environmental services provided by the forest. There are clearly benefits flowing from the existence of the forests. The real costs associated with the provision of the environmental services are not captured by the pricing mechanism of the market, because they are not attached to the cost of exploiting these assets for their timber values (Joisce 1996). Two approaches that attempt to capture both the costs of direct and indirect impacts have been advanced in the SEEA. They are maintenance costing and contingent valuation and other demand side valuations. Maintenance costing focuses on the impacts of production in assessing the costs of keeping the forest intact. Contingent and related valuation of the demand/benefits/damage side of environmental services, on the other hand, attempt to measure the loss or generation of ecological and environmental.
When market prices are unavailable, the 1993 SNA recommends these be valued at total production costs.
35 consumer services. Both approaches attempt to find, in principle, market values for measuring environmental costs and benefits (Bartelmus 1998). Maintenance costing searches for market values of factor inputs, required for the potential restoration or avoidance of environmental impacts caused by economic agents. Contingent and related demand-side or use valuations attempt to measure preferences for maintaining, restoring or improving environmental, as if markets exist for these services. Contingent valuation thus reflects the environmental cost borne by ecosystems and individuals. However, maintenance cost appears to exhibit characteristics of both the costcaused and cost-borne concepts, if restoration costs are included. Restoration costs represent the expenditures that society would have incurred to restore environmental quality lost in the past to desirable levels, expressed by "sustainability standards". These quality losses can of course not be tracked back to those who caused damages through emissions in past accounting periods or imported transboundary pollution from other economies. While reflecting maintenance cost concept of restoring environmental assets, restoration costs thus also represent the environmental costs accumulated and borne by society over time. The environmental cost accumulation represents an environmental debt. Environmental debt incurred by past generation indicates the responsibility of the current generations for environmental effects that would have to be borne by future generations. In its reference to an accumulated environmental burden, this concept is not strictly comparable with production and income aggregates. Maintenance cost is the imputed cost that would have been incurred if the environment had been sustainably used (undiminished future use). That, under the maintenance cost approach, is the cost of "protecting" the forest. Such costs would cover both direct and indirect services of the forest. Differing level of maintenance provide different cost levels. The cost of avoiding the loss of certain services would also affect other services provided by the forest. Therefore, when valuing each service separately, one should take special care not to double count the costs. Also, given the shortcomings of the different valuation techniques presented, it is important that physical data be maintained in detail to ensure that noneconomic issues are not overlooked, or obscured by disagreements on how to cost nonmarket phenomena. A short description of the indirect impacts, as listed in Table 14 is provided below. Valuation techniques that have been used in case studies for the estimation of these impacts are described. Such methods are not necessarily consistent with the SEEA. Soil erosion refers to changes in quality of the land, due to loss of topsoil. It affects the productivity of the land and can be due to natural causes as well as to economic activities, such as agriculture and forestry. Physical as well as monetary measures of soil erosion are complex. The universal soil erosion equation, includes rainfall erosivity, and soil erodibility factors and relies upon, length and steepness of the slope coupled with the degree of vegetative cover to measure average annual soil loss in physical terms (Narain and Nachtergaele 1998). Several valuation techniques have been proposed. Several methods are based on maintenance costs, that is the costs of nutrient replacement, of terracing the slope, of rehabilitating the plot to its former productive conditions, etc. The latter cost is a restoration cost and, as mentioned earlier it pertains to cost-borne type of valuation and therefore not consistent with the SEEA. Also, in the SEEA the value of soil erosion caused by logging on.
36 steep slope is considered to be an indirect impact of forest depletion and, therefore, its value is not deducted from the value added of forestry22. Carbon sequestration relates to the capability of forest to bind carbon and contribute to the prevention of global warming and climate changes. The carbon sequestration is usually estimated through physical models of forest types and land-use change. It depends on the species mix, the organic matter content of the species, the age distribution of the forest stand and soil and climate factors (Adger et al. 1995). In practice, carbon balances can be calculated by multiplying the elements of the physical asset accounts for forest, in volume, by the coefficients of dry matter content and of carbon concentration in the dry matter of the different species (see above and Hoffrén 1996). The SEEA, as mentioned before, embraces the cost caused approach, and therefore captures the cost of loss of carbon sequestration through the valuation of timber depletion and/or the valuation of emissions above absorption levels. Absorption level depends also on the carbon sequestration capacity of the forest. The cost of abating or avoiding CO2, N2O and CH4 emissions is estimated using end of pipe technology, substitution costs, etc. and deducted from the value added of the causing industry. Damage-valuations, instead, attempt to value global-warming value. Temperature changes are related to physical impacts, which are then valued. This involves various emission scenarios and damage and abatement functions. Such types of valuations, as mentioned above, are not consistent with production and income accounting. Watershed protection relates to mitigation of flooding, groundwater recharge, and reduction in the volume of runoff. Loss of watershed has an indirect impact on productivity of agricultural land, for example. The cost of loss of watershed could be estimated, with a demand side valuation, as the cost of mitigation of flood damage, purification of water from suspended sediments, etc. Quality of the forest ecosystems and health and vitality of forest ecosystems are related to the functions of the forest as habitat for flora and fauna and as providers of ecological services. These characteristics of the forest are the most complex to measure. The SEEA does not even attempt to put a monetary value on "environmental" forests, that is those forest that fall outside the production boundaries of the SNA. It recommends instead simply measuring the area of forest land. Indicators on the quality of the forests' ecosystems could be presented. Indicators on the health of ecosystems are obtained by linking landscape quality and biotope (plant community) quality with the stock of species in biotopes (Seibel et al.). Biodiversity therefore may constitute an important element of ecosystem health. In the SEEA, the number of endangered species as well as the number of individuals per species is reported in physical terms. While perhaps desirable it is not necessary to monetize the gains or losses in biodiversity. Recreational activities are indirectly included in the SNA as tourism expenditures. The question of which expenditures are considered as integral part of recreational expenditures is very relevant. Willingness to pay for the recreational experience has been estimated in several cases. Most of the time the results are site specific and are hardly extendable to the national level.
One approach adopted for agricultural soil erosion is to estimate rent losses due to decreased land productivity.
Impacts on Forests Caused by Non-forest Sector Activities.
Economic activities, even though not directly linked to the forest, may have negative impacts on the quality of the forests and reduce or enhance the capacity of forests to produce products and environmental services. The forest capacity of carbon sequestration allows industries to release emissions safely into the air, until the absorption level is met. The absorption level depends on the concentrations of pollutants in the air and the vegetative characteristics of the forests. If the air quality were such that the absorption level has already been saturated, acid depositions would affect foliage and soil and water body chemistry and broader aggregates of ecosystem health and productivity. In order to have a clear understanding of the impacts of pollution on forest; one should have information on the cause-effect relationship between emissions and environmental impacts. These relationships are hard to identify. Emission data describe the cause but not the effect of pollution. Environmental indicators/indices describe the state of the environment and yield clues about the effect but not specific links between the cumulative multiple sources and their respective damages. Rather, emissions are loosely linked to ambient concentration levels. In general, however, there is not adequate information on the influence mechanisms, the state, rate of damage changes, the means of prevention of extensive damage or the tolerance of various forest ecosystems to these disturbances. The present state of the forest "health" depends, on present and past activities as well as on transboundary airflows and the import and export of pollutants. It is usually not possible to identify which activity, when and in which country, caused the present state of the forest. In order to try to evaluate the impacts of economic activity on forests, three differing and complementing techniques, none of which are completely satisfactory, could be applied. They are: a) Conversion of emissions into theme equivalents ­ acidification, in the case of forests. Emissions contributing to acidification are weighted to form a single indicator, according to the acid forming potential of each pollutant. Also, domestic pollution is augmented with the imports and reduced with the exports, of pollutants. Despite the arbitrariness of the weights, such indicator of net air pollution in the country provides useful information on the amount of acid deposition in the country. b) Description of the change in the state of the forest in one year through environmental indicators/indices. Several indicators describing the quality of the forest are regularly compiled. One of the most commonly used is defoliation, which is the number of needles that are missing as compared to a healthy tree in the same forest. This indicator is described as a percentage of the missing needles or leaves. The reasons for needle loss are age of the trees, weather, climatic factors and pollution. Other environmental indicators of the health of the forest include biodiversity indicators, area of forest land, forest stock, etc. In order to evaluate the state of the forest, interpreting a large number of physical indicators; measured in different units can be complicated. Indices have been compiled aggregating the different indicators with weights. Given that little information is available on the relationship between the indicators, usually describing different aspects of the quality of the forest, the selection of weight is arbitrary. The choice of the weight might have a big impact on the magnitude of the indices, therefore, one should be cautious when interpreting indices of the state of the forests. Quality indicators have been linked to the asset accounts. Although physical indicators of the state of the forests reflect the impacts of activities that may have taken place elsewhere in previous accounting periods, they reflect impacts borne by the forests.
38 c) Monetary valuation of the damages caused by economic activities on forests. The valuation of the changes in the quality of forests in one year, as measured by changes in environmental indicators/indices, provide information on the "environmental debt" of the country (see above). Techniques used to monetize the impacts of economic activities on forests are based either on direct or indirect valuation methods. Direct valuation methods consist of estimating the willingness to pay of individuals to guarantee the existence of the forest or their willingness to accept reduction in their consumption or income to retain a stock of forests not impaired by economic activities. Problems with this method include the following. Respondents to survey questions may not have sufficient information concerning the costs and benefits of forests so that their responses are poor indicators of more informed values. Survey respondents may also not be easily able to express their values in monetary terms. Indirect methods estimate damage costs in the form of loss of production or costs accrued in avoiding such loss.This method allows the use of market prices, in order to evaluate the costs to society (National Institute of Economic Research and Statistics Sweden 1994). The SEEA provides an integrated database, which could serve as a starting point for the evaluation of the impacts of economic activities on forest, both in physical and monetary terms, as described in a), b) and c). Emissions are recorded by industry and impact the domestic and international environment. They are then valued at maintenance costs to assess the costs of the direct impacts of production on the environmental asset changes. Damage valuation methods, reported in c), while providing useful information, are not fully consistent with the SNA and, therefore do not enter in the calculation of environmentallyadjusted aggregates. 3.8 Environmentally-adjusted Economic Aggregates.
A forest sector SEEA allows the calculation of a range of economic aggregates which reflect cost adjustments23. For example, a supply-use identity is an indicator of the supply of goods and services produced and imported in the Forest sector. It is equal to the use in intermediate and final consumption, capital formation and export. If all forest uses are properly linked, it will yield an indicator of all forest benefits. Also, a forestry environmentallyadjusted value-added identity can be calculated. This describes value-added for the sector net of depletion and degradation costs. Finally, an environmentally adjusted domesticproduct identity for the whole economy may also be calculated. This is the environmentally adjusted value added of all industries with a further reduction of household generated environmental costs. This later index will allow better inter-industry comparisons of economic performance.
This discussion is based on UNSD (1997).
Country Experiences: Selected Case Studies, Trials, and Policy Recommendations.
There have been a variety of experiences in establishing satellite accounts for the forest sector and in using data typically found in such accounts in evaluating sustainable development issues. Some studies have been initiated with the fundamental purpose of establishing new accounts and accounting procedures so that robust information will be available on an annual basis for the kinds of policy analyses discussed in the first chapter of this report. Other studies have been essentially policy oriented in nature. Vincent and Hardwick (1997) provide an excellent review of the breadth of sustainable forest development studies. The primary thrust of many of the studies they reviewed was to utilize data similar to what has been proposed for forest sector satellite accounts in analyzing sustainable development. The range of experiences is rather broad. Eurostat, the statistical division of the European Union, has initiated a 5 country pilot study with the fundamental purpose of developing harmonized accounting procedures for all member countries. Experiences from the first year of these trials are reported in this chapter. The Statistical Division of the United Nations (UNSD), along with other international agencies, has helped several countries develop economic and environmental accounts. Much of this work was done before the development of standardized accounting procedures cited in chapter 3 of this report, although the accounts are consistent with this material. FAO commissioned four case studies, and the World Bank sponsored two studies through the Danish Trustfund of Environmentally and Sustainable Development. A key thrust of these studies focused on sustainable forestry issues with particular attention to prospects and potential problems associated with timber asset valuation procedures proposed by Vincent and Hartwick (1997). These commissioned studies contrast with those initiated by Eurostat and UNSD because they were not concerned with robust accounting principles per se, but rather on asset valuation and sustainability. In addition to these commissioned case studies, trials and the assisted implementation of new satellite accounts, there has been a wide array of sustainable development studies of the forest sector. Some of these investigations have been done as national income accounting exercises and others have been essentially policy analyses which utilize the kind of data that would be found in forest sector satellite accounts if they existed. Many important lessons can be learned from these broad and varied experiences. What problems are there in data sources? How have assets be valued? What approaches have been used in monetizing nonmarket goods and services? What kinds of sustainable development issues have been addressed? Is the thrust of these studies the depletion of timber assets or broader forest ecosystem level concerns? How has depletion been defined? What has been the relationship between forest assets in the SNA and forests in the SEEA? How have inter-industry impacts been treated? In this chapter we examine and summarize these broad experiences with the purpose of providing insights to those that will develop and utilize forest sector satellite accounts. Following the discussion of country experiences, the chapter and report conclude with a set or priority actions, capacity building and training needs.
Eurostat's Experience with Forest Sector Accounting Trials.
The framework for forest accounting grew out of Eurostat's broader program for the development of Natural Resources Accounting, (see Joisce, (1996) report of the London Group Stockholm session). This framework constituted the first step of the program on the forest sector and focused on the integration of physical and monetary balance sheets, physical and monetary supply-use tables and economic accounts for forestry. Subsequent steps for the incorporation of additional environmental concerns will be initiated during 1998, and will encompass non-SNA forest values. In 1996-1997, five countries, under contracts with Eurostat, agreed to test ten main tables derived from the accounting framework. The purpose of the pilot exercises was to test the proposed forest accounting framework to determine what kinds of problems might be encountered if the system is more broadly implemented. The essence of the framework included the following objectives, which broadly shape the evaluation of the pilot studies. - - - - To link in a consistent way, physical and monetary data, To link flow and stocks accounts, To introduce some environmental concerns, To formulate an accounting framework that allows for the calculation of most of the indicators retained by the Ministerial Conference on the protection of forests in Europe (Helsinki 1993), as well as a comprehensive description of the interactions between human activities and forests as a component of natural environment.
Two essential aspects of the accounting framework are balance sheets and flow accounts. 4.2.1 Balance Sheets.
Balance sheets represent the essential classification of forest assets. Starting from internationally agreed-upon forest definitions (FAO, UN-ECE), this classification is intended to be the basis for describing the main changes in the status of forests. The accounting objective of providing a more detailed trend of European forest changes was to be accomplished by coupling balance sheets through cross-classification with economic issues. For example, an attempt was made to integrate defoliation and mortality of forests to reflect changes in forest sector benefits. In addition, the benefits of carbon accumulation in forests as a global environmental benefit were integrated within the physical forest balance sheets. On the monetary side of the forest balance sheets, no specific approach to value estimation was required of the participating countries. Rather, the choice was left to countries with the recommendation that the methods be simple, easily reproducible, and not particularly demanding of data. 4.2.2 Flow Accounts.
Flow accounts describe levels or rates of activities within an accounting period. Descriptions of activities can be expressed in physical terms or monetary terms. Examples of physical flows are changes in land use, the growth of cultivated timber within a year, amount of timber felled, and the amount of logs consumed. The monetary counterpart to physical flows is rates of money flows. For example, the monetary counterpart to the physical volume of timber felled in a year is the annual value of the stumpage payments. The objective in establishing these accounts is to provide data necessary to link the forest sector flow activities with flows.
41 in other economic sectors. For example, if the forest sector sold logs to the sawmill sector, the monetary flows represent the links between the two sectors. A "Forest Resource Use and Management Account" was proposed, as well a description of residuals flows. 4.2.3 Proposed Tables.
Fifteen tables were drafted in order to test the proposed European forest accounting framework. These tables represent a starting point and were not intended to cover all the forests issues and aspects addressed by the accounting framework. The composition of the 15 tables included the following items. - Balance sheets in physical and monetary terms (areas and volume of standing timber): 4 tables - Output related to forests and economic accounts for forestry 3 tables - Supply use tables in physical and monetary terms 4 tables + 2 complementary tables on residuals - Mass balances: 2 tables + a complementary table 4.2.4 Experience and Insights.
The pilot exercises were originally intended to test the feasibility of the framework concerning classification issues, and the separation of economic accounts between forestry and logging. Valuable and somewhat unanticipated lessons concerning forest valuation were also forthcoming. The experimental exercises also provided important insights into the changing character of European forests although these results should be considered as unofficial. 4.2.4.1 Classification and Physical Balances In general the statistical offices took the position that all European forests are exploitable for wood production and are more or less "cultivated". However, in fact, some forests are nonexploitable either because they are protected or inaccessible. Within the class of exploitable forests, it is possible and at times useful to distinguish between forests that result from "afforestation" in recent time periods (e.g. 20 years) as opposed to regularly managed forests or more mature forests, or stands without any intervention for at least 25-30 years. This classification may be very important because the later class of timber is more likely to be harvested in the near term than the former and as a result is implicitly more valuable. The pilot exercises point to the need to harmonize classifications before drawing any conclusion from the data. It is clear that the share of non-exploitable forests vary widely between countries either due to different definitions of protection or accessibility. Using national forest inventory (NFI) data did not present any insurmountable problems in determining physical balances of forest land and standing timber over a five-year period. These balances do not show great variation in terms of total forest area. However, they do indicate a general movement from "non protected" to "protected" status while at the same time showing an increase of stocks of standing timber in exploitable forests.
4.2.4.2 Introducing Forest Quality Classifications Quality classifications were introduced in the accounting framework. The objective was to provide a basis for examining trends in the physical degradation of forests thereby providing a basis for the corresponding valuation of forest losses. Germany was successful in crossclassifying economic and quality characteristics. Sweden and Finland only were able to provide information in annex tables. None of the countries reported forest degradation in their monetary balance sheets. It became apparent that in order to value forest degradation, it is necessary to have both physical data and different prices for the various quality classes of timber. Apparently this kind of information is not readily available. Furthermore, if a present value approach were applied to the balance sheets for forests, it would be necessary to use different natural growth rates for the various quality classes as an expression of degradation. This in turn would have to be coupled with discounted (and apparently unavailable) quality class prices. Based on the problems with valuing forest degradation, it may be necessary to reevaluate the continuation of this component of forest sector accounting. Whether or not a full cross-classification of economic and quality parameters shall continue to be included in the accounts must be discussed. The German report shows that the cross-classification is feasible. Other countries had lesser success in these initial ventures. 4.2.5 Monetary Valuation.
Forest valuation has traditionally involved development of separate values for land and standing timber. Because timber is sold more often as an asset to be removed from the land than is the case of the combined sale of land with standing timber, timber values are typically more readily available than are forest land values. Furthermore, when forestland is sold with standing timber, both assets are commonly included in a single transaction price. Valuation of land was approached by using either actual or "recommended" (prices set by qualified land appraisers) prices for sales of transacted forest real estate. This method seems preferable to any other. However, further analysis may have to be done to determine how variation in the characteristics (for example difference in tree species, timber volumes, and development rights) of the real estate transactions contributes to explaining variation in real estate prices24. In subsequent studies, a variety of approaches for estimating land values will be conducted. These approaches include market values, recommended values, alternative use values (marginal agricultural land values may be particularly meaningful), and capitalized rent values. A variety of approaches were utilized in the valuation of standing timber. For example, Sweden and Finland use stumpage prices while Germany uses a hedonic pricing method. Although valid comparisons are not always possible, it appears that the asset value of the total forest, which is the sum of land and standing timber values, is very high relative to the actual transactions received. This point should be carefully examined and given considerable thought.
Quite incidentally, Jackson (1997) just completed a consulting study for the Montana Department of Natural Resources which studied forested real estate transactions an was able to separate the value from standing timber from other land asset values.
43 4.2.6 Economic Accounts for Forestry and Logging.
The intent of the original proposal was to define all trees in exploitable forests as cultivated. This essentially implies that all timber growth in exploitable forests is an output contributing to GDP25 . As a consequence, separate accounts for forestry and logging were advocated so that the benefits could be separated. This was only done in a consistent way by one country. Because the aim in the accounting framework is to link economic accounts with balance sheets, as well as to link monetary data with physical data, it would be useful to actually complete this part of the pilot exercises independent of the decision taken by national accountants. This would provide more meaningful information and help further evaluate the trial accounting framework. An interesting result of the exercise is that, with the exception of Germany, the rate of return of Forestry is 2.5 - 3%, when the value of standing timber is calculated by stumpage prices. This rate of return is low in some respects. However, in developed countries, the long-term real rate of return on capital, before adjustments have been made for natural resource depletion, has been on the order of 2 to 4 %. It appears that the preliminary forest sector rates of return are in keeping with the overall long-term performance of the developed economies. Perhaps one reason that the rate of return was higher in the German case study is their apparent reliance on hedonic stumpage prices. The term hedonic means "quality adjusted" prices. In comparing the average quality of timber being harvested with that of less mature growing "work-in-progress" timber, one would expect quality differences. Timber quality normally improves with growth so that the value per unit of volume of mature timber should exceed the value per unit of volume of maturing timber. This means that the average value per unit of volume of growing stock is typically less than the average value per unit of volume of timber being cut. If the value of growing stock is not adjusted downward to reflect it's lower average quality, timber receipts as a percentage value of stock will appear unrealistically low26. Other products related to forest and other wooded land (berries, mushrooms, game, recreational fees, etc., either market or for own final use) were partially identified by the different national exercises. Forest management expenditures were not desegregated and separately allocated for these products. 4.2.7 Supply and Use Tables: Mass Balances.
The purpose of developing supply and use tables is first to provide a consistent linkage between economic uses. Particularly important are the linkages between final wood product consumption and exports and the resulting derived demand for timber. This most fundamental linkage demonstrates the importance of forest resources in a national economy.
This does not seem to be the position of Eurostat EAF (revised edition). However, if natural growth is not recorded as output in balance sheets, the relationship between excess growth in relation to fellings will have to be treated as "other changes in the volume of assets". Jackson and McQuillan(1979) developed a hedonic pricing method which uses the diameter distribution of timber sold to predict timber prices, Small trees are worth less per unit of volume than large trees. Stand growth models typically project the diameter distribution of timber stands so that diameter based prices may be an excellent way of allowing prices to change for maturing forests. This would place lower asset values on young timber than old timber in mass appraisals such as are being deployed in these studies. Forest management that converts from large timber to smaller timber is also a form of forest degradation and wealth depletion.
44 Due to the differences between national classifications of activities and products and the European classification of industries and products (NACE Rev.1 and CPA) it was not always possible to fill in the proposed tables according to common classifications. Moreover, in some cases, owing to unavailable data, uses and supply could not be matched. Some additional work is necessary because data concerning the supply and use of wood are apparently inconsistent and can't be matched with corresponding elements in economic accounts. Residuals are the left over waste products associated with production. Another important objective of the pilot studies was to describe flows of wood and paper wastes as well as residuals linked with forest related activities. This objective was more or less accomplished in the in the area of wood and paper waste products. However the lack of detailed data for the waste treatment and recycling industry hampers the elaboration of accounting for residuals balances. 4.2.8 General Assessment of the Eurostat Pilot Exercises.
The main conclusion from the limited initial exercises is that consistent integration of physical and monetary data, along with flows and asset stocks is not straightforward. This is true even for countries which have comparatively well developed forest data bases and where the initial experience focuses simply on reformatting and delineating SNA transactions and balance sheets. Assessment of actual maintenance costs or forests protection expenditures will necessitate further analytic efforts as will the choice of a harmonized valuation method. Besides consolidating the experiences of the first pilot exercises, there may be adjustments in the accounting framework as well. The objective of the next phase of developing natural resource accounting, scheduled for the current year, will be an attempt to integrate "non SNA" values. However, there will be no attempt to modify the aggregates of system of integrated accounts. Even when previously mentioned market valuation issues are solved, the remaining key problems appear to be the development of approaches to handle these "non SNA" values. The following represents a more detailed list of aspects of these non-SNA values and associated issues. - - - - - Are non-SNA values already (partially or totally) included in some SNA valuations? Are non-SNA values actual values? Are non-SNA values comparable with SNA values? Are non-SNA values additives? When extending the production boundary of SNAs in order to include natural services, how should the services be treated?.
At the next stage of model construction, the objective of satellite monetary accounting should be to propose a consistent treatment (consistent both in terms of contemporary economic analysis and SNA conventions and concepts) of the important nontimber economic values. Finally, further consideration should be given to some of the recent studies on valuation such as Hulkrantz's (1992) Swedish study. This study included many important nonmarket values and found that when these values were included, value added was substantially larger.
Implementation Experiences in Countries assisted by UNSD.
The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), with the financial support of UNEP, UNDP and The World Bank, has provided technical assistance to several countries for the implementation of the SEEA. One component of the SEEA compilation consists of forest accounts, although other important environmental accounts have also been instituted. The first set of countries that tested the feasibility of the SEEA before the publication of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (1993) were Mexico and Papua New Guinea in 1992. Satellite accounts were next implemented in the Republic of Korea, Philippines, Ghana and Colombia between 1993 and 1998. The account compilation methodology used in these six countries is consistent with methodology presented in this report. All case studies used data already available from government sources and from special studies. The valuation method for depletion allowance used for all the following case studies is the net price method. 4.3.1 Philippines.
The National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB), with the technical assistance of UNSD completed the SEEA implementation project. The project was carried out jointly with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Asset accounts for forests, fish, mineral resources, land/soil and water were compiled for the period 1988-1994 in physical and in monetary terms. In addition, emissions costs for selected industries were estimated and environmentally modified indicators were calculated. The forest accounts included accounts for dipterocarps, pines, mangroves, mossy and submarginal forests. Rattan accounts were the only non-timber product account included for dipterocarp forests because rattan has a significant economic value. Forest depletion was the most significant part of the environmental cost generated during the period 1988-1991. After the introduction of the logging ban in 1992, the depletion as well as the contribution of the forestry industry to NDP (0.39% in 1994) decreased substantially. Figures on the forest and land accounts are currently being revised. 4.3.2 Colombia.
The Administration Department of National Statistics (DANE), with the technical assistance of UNSD, implemented the Colombian System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (COLSEEA). The project was carried out jointly by the Interagency Committee on Environmental Accounts (CICA), involving DANE, the National Department of Planning (DNP), the Ministry of Environment, the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environment Studies and UNEP. Environmental protection expenditures of industries, households and government along with accounts for mineral resources, forest, land and water were compiled. Accounts were compiled for produced and non-produced economic forests as well as for noneconomic environmental forests. Changes in the opening and closing forest stocks were reported in both volume and biomass and were estimated using data generated by special studies27. Deforestation caused by illegal logging and fuelwood production was included in the asset accounts and estimated income generated from nontimber forest uses was limited to eco-tourism and the production of pharmaceutical product values.
Attempts were made in special studies to estimate and monetize important environmental forest functions for water volume regulation and soil protection.
46 4.3.3 Republic of Korea.
Korea Environment Institute, with the technical assistance of UNSD, has just completed a pilot compilation of the SEEA. Asset accounts for land, forests, fish and mineral resources as well as environmental protection expenditures and emissions into land, air and water were estimated. Deforestation and forest depletion do not constitute an environmental concern in Korea. Forest stocks have been increasing steadily, as a result of extensive reforestation and protection policies. The contribution of forestry to GDP was only 0.2%. 4.3.4 Ghana.
Ghana Statistical Service, with the technical assistance of UNSD and the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) coupled with financial support from UNEP undertook a pilot SEEA compilation. Asset accounts for timber, marine fish, subsoil assets, water, and forestland were compiled for the period 1991-1993. Even though the importance of nontimber forest products is recognized in the Ghanaian economy, it was not possible to obtain data estimates necessary to compile broad forest sector accounts. The value of forest land was estimated using adjusted compensation rates paid by the mining companies for forest destruction. No estimate of the allowable cut was available, it was therefore not possible to estimate depletion relative to a ceiling rate of harvest (UNSD's approach to hard sustainability). 4.3.5 Mexico.
The project was carried out in 1990 and 1991 jointly by UNSD, the World Bank and the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI) in Mexico. Attention focused on the following environmental concerns for the year 1985: oil depletion, land, water, and soil degradation, deforestation and changes in land use. Timber accounts as well as land use accounts (including land use changes) were calculated. Environmental protection expenditures by the forestry industry were estimated to be very low. A depletion allowance was calculated and deducted from the value added of the forestry industry. The environmentally adjusted value added turned out to be 27.2% of the value added for forestry28. The contribution of the forestry industry dropped from 0.54% of NDP to 0.15% of environmentally adjusted NDP when depletion was incorporated in the production accounts and nonforest products were excluded. The capital output ratio, an indicator of the capital productivity of the sector dropped from 45.38% to 12.34% when natural capital was added to produced capital with depletion accounting. 4.3.6 Papua New Guinea.
UNSD and The World Bank carried out environmental account implementation in 1992. SEEA was compiled for 1986-1990 and included forests, mineral resources and energy accounts. Forest asset accounts were compiled for "economic" (i.e. that have a potential economic use for logging activities) and "environmental" (i.e. forest land non-accessible for logging operation, mountain areas, etc.) forests. The forestry industry is comparatively small and represents about 4.1% of GDP. Lack of reliable data on timber production did not allow the estimation of depletion. An attempt was made to estimate the value of losses of ecological functions due to exploitation. The estimates were on the estimated compensation.
This is calculated on the narrowly defined forest industry ISIC 02.
47 costs by logging companies to landowners and amounted to a range of 0.4-2.3 % of NDP and 6.4 ­ 39.3% of NVA of the forestry industry29. 4.3.7 Experience of UNSD Assisted Countries.
Several points are noteworthy in these studies. First, existing data sources had to be augmented by special studies. Second, forest resources varied from country to country. For example, some countries limited the forest sector to timber. Others added eco-tourism, fuelwood, rattan, or pharmaceutical values. No country examined carbon sequestering services or their value. It appears that broad multiple-use values were not consistently appraised and included in forest sector accounts. Virtually no country had good timber prices so the net-price values had to be estimated as residual values. Of course, one would expect that the inclusion of depletion would reduce estimates of value added. The change in the amount of value added in Mexico seems to be "surprisingly large". 4.4 A Summary of the FAO/World Bank Commissioned Studies.
Case studies in Brazil, Chile, Philippines and Zimbabwe were supported and directed by FAO and the World Bank with the primary purpose of examining the feasibility of utilizing the valuation approaches proposed by Vincent and Hartwick (1997) to evaluate sustainable development. Each included country faces unique sustainable development dilemmas. At the same time, many problems are shared somewhat in common in developing the necessary information to evaluate the contribution of the forestry sector to a society's long term economic well-being. As a result, we start this part of the chapter with a summary and overview of the particular focus of each case study. In doing this, we examine the physical accounts utilized in the case study, the approach to valuation and then we briefly restate the conclusions. Following the presentation of each case, we look at patterns in analytical problems and make broader suggestions about the usefulness of forest sector information in these approaches to policy analysis concerning sustainable forestry. 4.4.1 Brazil.
Seroa da Motta and Ferraz do Amaral (1997) examine rates of depletion of both Mahogany and all other timber in the Brazilian Amazon. The area excludes the state of Mato Grosso but includes the area referred to as the Legal Amazon. The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest and its socio-political-bioeconomic importance is reflected by the authors' exclusive focus on the region's timber sustainability. No estimates of other forest benefits are included. The physical accounts are suggested, rather than directly enumerated and are represented by stock estimates in 1990 and 1995 for "all timber". In addition, there is a 1990 estimate of the stock of "mahogany". There are no land accounts, nor are there neither other indicators of timber quality nor ways of adjusting outputs in other economic sectors. There is also no direct adjustment of GDP for timber assets in the Amazon. This study relied upon estimates of stumpage price and production costs. They use the Vincent and Hardwick approach. Stumpage values are net of average extraction costs. In the absence of any estimate of the elasticity of marginal extraction costs, the authors do a.
The SEEA does not recommend deduction from GDP.
48 sensitivity analysis using two extreme (0 and infinity) and more informed rates of 1 and.
In addition, they also do a sensitivity analysis of the discount rate with values of .02, .04 and .10. The authors were able to obtain average prices of sawn logs but only average rather than marginal costs of costs of logging and extraction were available. This made the development of the valuation approach proposed by Vincent & Hardwick (1997) very difficult. Of course the sensitivity analysis creates a variety of estimates concerning the longevity of both mahogany and all timber assets. In all cases the mahogany asset liquidation is expected to be completed many orders of magnitudes earlier than for all timber. This suggests that there is a qualitative degradation of the timber resource. Because, the report doesn't examine changes in the forest sector's wealth, it was not possible to look at the broader view of sustainable development. The authors experienced many data availability problems. It would have been useful to more broadly examine changes in land use, timber wealth, and related forest benefits in a broader context of sustainability. Furthermore, the issue of dual issues of both inoperable stocks and unused harvests looms large in areas like the Amazon. For example, if unused harvests represent 50% of the volume removed, and substantial areas are inoperable, the longevity or sustainability of the harvests could be very different from the conclusions of this study. 4.4.2 Chile.
Vergas and Sandoval (1997) examine the sustainability of timber produced from short rotation timber plantations (cultivated economic assets). There is no attempt to examine changes in land use, nor other forest benefits. The study is limited to areas planted in plantations for the periods of 1985-1996. For growing stock, the inventory includes land areas and ages of both species for annual ages from 1 to 20 years, the typical harvest age in the plantations. There were no adjustments for catastrophic losses or for other market or non-market forest benefits. Plantations account for the industrial basis of forest products in Chile, although the plantations account for only 2.8% of the total surface of the country while the native forests account for 17.8% of the total land area. Separate asset values for plantations of each of two tree species were calculated using the modified El Serafy approach. Since the plantations are intensively managed around 20 year rotations, an asset value for each age was multiplied by the appropriate number of hectares for that age in accumulating the plantation asset value. Costs of timber extraction were constant, as were stumpage prices during the period of analysis. Timber prices were estimated using the residual value method of timber appraisal rather than using observable stumpage prices. From the standpoint of forest plantations, Chile has been accumulating wealth. Based on current plantations and rates of growth and harvesting, asset accumulation is expected to continue through the end of a 20 year forecast period. In other words, the plantations represent a sustainable form of wealth accumulation in the nation's economy. Also evident was the effect of a policy modification toward the end of the period of analysis that reduced the incentives to develop plantations. Corresponding with the policy change was a lower, but still positive rate of increase in the plantation land base and resulting lower rate of asset accumulation. From the standpoint of a broader calculation of forest benefits, it would be interesting to know what land uses were being replaced with the addition of forest plantations. Also, it would appear that carbon sequestering would be a net benefit of plantation accumulation and a reasonably simple extension of the analysis. No attempts were made to estimate value.
49 added from forest plantations. Also, even in plantations, there may be unused harvests, so that the asset values may be overstated. 4.4.3 Zimbabwe.
Mabugu, Milne, and Campbell (1997,1998) evaluate the sustainability and economic importance of fuelwood in Zimbabwe. About 70% of the nation's energy consumption is derived from wood. Fuelwood use is a contributing factor to deforestation, and recently was rated as the most serious environmental problem facing the country. Fuelwood use is a case of an unreported forest value and as a result, the role of forests in providing fuelwood is easily overlooked. Furthermore, using the usual indicators of welfare such as pre capita GDP, the economy has been in steady decline throughout the early to mid 1990s. Thus, developing better estimates of the sustainability of natural resources and wealth are very important to Zimbabwe. Essentially, two accounts are utilized, a land account and a timber account. The forest land account has been experiencing about a 2% annual rate of loss to agricultural uses during the period of 1986-1995. In assessing the timber stock and growth available for fuelwood collection, further reductions were made in the accounts due to the protected nature of some lands such as national parks. Growth estimates were made in terms of mean annual increment (MAI). Estimates of fuelwood consumption had to be made by utilizing studies of the number of households using fuelwood and fuelwood consumption rates. The consumption estimates were adjusted downward to fuelwood removals by deducting estimates of supplies from drywood and land clearances. One thorny problem is to estimate the costs of fuelwood collection. The report relies on an opportunity cost approach since most fuelwood is informally collected rather than compensated work. This kind of work is almost universally left out of national income estimates. Costs depend on the time involved and because deforestation takes place near residences first, costs increase with distance traveled to collect wood. This suggests that costs will rise with time and with total fuelwood harvested. The value of fuelwood was estimated using market prices of fuelwood. Hotelling rent is determined by converting the total rent by Vincent and Hardwick's conversion factor formula using an annual interest rate of .18 and an elasticity of marginal cost of.
There was literally no estimate of the elasticity of marginal costs so the authors essentially had to assume a number in order to complete the valuation work. Finally the estimated value of fuelwood was added to create an adjusted GDP and NDP. Fuelwood adjustments represent about a 1-% adjustment to GDP. This is substantial and suggests that estimating other forest benefits is likely to produce a much better indication of the importance of forests to national well being. With forests disappearing at an annual rate of 2%, this may indicate some need for new policy analysis. The authors found a variety of problems in collecting and utilizing data. For example, they had hoped to readjust GDP in the energy sector to reflect the reliance on wood energy but were unable to do so. They recommend a different and more useable form of data collection in the future. Adding the value of wood fuel consumption to the national income measures of well being in Zimbabwe helps develop a better understanding of sustainability. There is currently adequate forest growth to sustain levels of fuelwood consumption. However, because fuelwood use has such local spatial collection economies, there may still be major problems that aren't reflected.in this scope of analysis. Because national accounts examine changes in economic aggregates, these kinds of sustainability issues may still be overlooked in forest sector satellite accounts. There should be a way of cross walking between the national and local levels of analysis.
50 4.4.4 The FAO/World Bank Commissioned Studies in Retrospect.
Perhaps most interesting from the standpoint of broad patterns is the lack of good timber inventory data. Even in the case of the Chilean plantations, managed stand yield projections were used and coupled with records of land areas planted as a means of estimating the inventory of wood in each annual age class. The most difficult timber and forest inventory problems, which really preclude good estimates of the value of this kind of natural wealth, were found in Brazil and Zimbabwe. Each study was also confronted with problems in resource valuation where timber pricing was not a particularly easy accounting venture. In spite of the normal economic classification of timber as a market good, imperfect market arrangements make it very difficult to estimate the true worth of the timber. Some countries had reasonably good estimates of the costs of growing and tending timber. Where the examination focused on native forests as opposed to plantations, it was difficult to separate operable from inoperable forest lands and also to adequately examine how qualitative differences in timber affected asset and flow values. Recalling that an important element of the Vincent and Hartwick (1997) approach to valuation relies on knowledge of the elasticity of the marginal cost of logging, it is fair to say that data of this type is in extremely short supply. Seroa da Motta and Ferraz de Amaral (1997) provide interesting insights into and critiques of the limitations of the Vincent and Hardwick approach. Finally, in all of the countries there is little evidence of knowledge of unused harvests and their impact on sustainability. In Zimbabwe, fuelwood harvests are estimated from household surveys. In Brazil, harvests were estimated from mill production data and in the plantations of Chile, it was simply assumed that utilization of a mature plantation was complete. 4.5 Broad Patterns in National Income Based Forest Sector Studies.
Having identified the broad view of total forest benefits and total forest values that are germane to sustainable forestry and sustainable development in an earlier chapter, we now turn our attention to a different form of experiences. Here we ask the question, where have people focused their studies to date? Has the main focus been on the sustainability of timber and forest lands or has the attention instead been placed on the broader array of forest benefits? Have analysts been more interested in the asset accounts (balance sheets) or the flow accounts? Have countries in one region of the world been more likely to examine sustainable development from a national income accounting perspective than another region? And how many studies actually looked at the contribution of the forest sector, either broadly or narrowly conceived, to national income? Dube, Jackson and Narain (1998) utilized the summary of studies presented in Vincent and Hardwick to examine patterns in these studies. Since the late 1980s, the greatest number of studies that have aimed at incorporating forest resources into the national accounts pertains to countries in Asia, and the least to countries in Africa. The number of studies increased more or less steadily during the 1990s, with the greatest number, nearly a dozen, being published or otherwise made available in 1996. Several more are in preparation under the auspices of the UN Statistical Division. Only twelve of the studies appear to have involved government agencies responsible for the preparation of national accounts. The benchmark study is the well-known examination of Indonesia by the World Resources Institute (Repetto, 1988). This is the most frequently cited study on natural resources (including forest resources) and the national accounts. A study for the World Bank by Peskier (1989), which commented on the WRI study and contained additional estimates for.
51 Tanzania, came next. Most of the studies covered one or more resources in addition to forests. That is, they did not focus exclusively on forests. More than half covered subsoil assets in addition to forests. Other non-forest resources included agricultural soils, rangeland, fisheries, and, in a few instances, air and water pollution. The forestry-specific studies tended to be the more recent ones and covered the longest time periods. In particular, the Canada studies analyzed the longest period, from the early 1960s to the early 1990s. Most studies, whether forestry-specific or more comprehensive, covered at least one decade. Virtually all the studies included timber, and nearly half covered one or more nontimber aspects of forest resources. The list includes nonmarket production of fuelwood, berries, mushrooms, game, rattan, and peat; amenity values associated with protected areas and biodiversity; environmental services like watershed protection and soil protection; carbon sequestration; and acid deposition. Some studies made adjustments to both flow (current) and asset accounts, while others made adjustments to just one or the other. Of those that made adjustments to current accounts, about two-thirds made adjustments for net accumulation. In most cases, the net accumulation estimates were for timber, although a few studies included nontimber values in calculations of net accumulation of forest land. Five studies estimated the value of nonmarket production of forest goods, which is an adjustment to GDP. One study (Finland) investigated a specific SNA recommendation, that timber growth in "cultivated" forests be valued and added to GDP. New Zealand has already implemented this recommendation for some time. About a third of the studies made adjustments related to asset accounts. In most cases, they simply calculated the value of the standing forest, without formally linking the estimates to stock and flow accounts. A few did, however, and compared the asset value of forest resources to the value of other assets in the economy. Malaysia studies, in addition to focusing on adjustments at the national level, also adjusted income accounts at the subnational level. They found that the impacts of net accumulation adjustments varied greatly within the country, with important implications for regional sustainability. 4.6 Knowledge Gained from Country Experiences.
The promise of full benefit accounting for the forestry sector in the evolving national income accounting procedures is great. But, the potential also exists to do the forests and people of the world a lot of harm if the new accounting systems are illframed, poorly implemented or if inadequate, erroneous, or incomplete data is utilized in the accounting systems. We now examine the four kinds of experiences in aggregate. The fundamental question is what can be gained from looking at the EUROSTAT trials, the UNSD assisted examples of implemented forest sector accounts, the FAO/World Bank commissioned studies, and the broad pattern of other investigations. We hope to be able to use the experiences to uncover any potential conceptual problems, persistent patterns of inadequate data, or other problems that may help in developing and using forest sector satellite accounts. 4.6.1 Experiences and Potential Problems with the Physical Measures of Forests.
Chapter 1 discussed the importance of physical measures of forests, timber, and related resources. The inventory of forest lands and standing timber is never a simple problem. Collecting inventory data is expensive and countries define lands and timber volumes in ways that are not always completely comparable. In the Brazilian Amazon, there really was no timber inventory. Rather, some sample plots were used to extrapolate an estimate of the mass of timber over an area which itself is hard to estimate in total size. The Chilean study.
52 had estimates of the plantation land base and estimated timber inventory by coupling the planting date with yield projections. In Zimbabwe, forest inventory has traditionally focused on plantation forests so that the authors of that case study were faced with making some informed, but somewhat ad hoc estimates of growth in the natural forests. Coupling the problems of estimating a traditional timber inventory with emerging needs to examine quantitative aspects of forests in nontraditional ways was driven home from the EUROSTAT trials. The volume of standing timber maybe a reasonable indicator of carbon storage. However, considerable effort must go into examining total carbon storage and uptake throughout the life of both economic and noneconomic forests in order to gain better knowledge about the relationship between the commercial measures of stem biomass and total forest carbon uptake and storage. There are no standard commonly accepted ways of measuring biodiversity. In fact there are several conflicting measures. In the absence of a readily accepted physical biodiversity index, less robust criteria and indicators might be included in forest sector satellite accounts. Timber inventory data was apparently not a major problem in the EUROSTAT trials, but lack of a harmonized inter-union measure of operable lands apparently was a problem. This measure should not be based exclusively on physical parameters of forest sites. Costs and values must also define inoperable lands. Likewise, isolated sites that are otherwise productive may never the less be inoperable. The cost structure of logging can easily differ between countries. Operable sites in one economy may be inoperable elsewhere. There was no attempt to define the operable land base in the Brazilian Amazon. The Zimbabwe case study did make an operability adjustment concerning the production of fuelwood. It also recognized that the costs of fuelwood gathering were a function of the distance traveled to collect fuelwood, although it is not clear whether this form of location economies was part of the operability definition. Finally, some country experiences indicate that measures of log removals are a poor indicator of logging depletion. Without good estimates of logging related mortality, log removals will understate depletion. In some developing countries this form of data problem could convert what appears to be net accumulation to net depletion. Thus log flows to wood using industries must typically be converted by a physical coefficient in order to convert log removal flows to reductions in standing timber stocks. The coefficient essentially represents "unused" harvests. 4.6.2 Experiences in Quantifying and Valuing Forest Benefits.
The country experiences reveal a variety of problems in valuation. Not only are there problems in valuing nonmarket resources, there are also problems in valuing timber and forest land as well. In the Brazilian case study the most reliable market prices were for sawn logs and these values had to be adjusted to estimate the value of the standing timber resource. Furthermore, timber in the Amazon is treated as an open-access resource and the prices under these circumstances can't reflect its competitive value. In the Chilean case study, the residual value method was used to estimate timber prices. It is an approach that subtracts average costs for an average operator from average product values. In an auction system, bid prices are determined by the interaction of marginal costs and marginal values, not averages. The "average cost operator" doesn't win a timber auction. Thus, the residual value appraisal system can create bias that persistently understates actual timber values. Virtually all of the countries that implemented accounts with UNSD assistance used similar estimating procedures. When timber value is underestimated, all estimates of value added are understated as well.
53 Timber valuation methods in the EUROSTAT trials were left to each country. In countries that used stumpage prices to value the entire forest inventory (balance sheet asset value), the apparent estimated rates of return were 2.5 to 3%. Germany used a hedonic method and the apparent rate of return was higher. Apparently by using quality-adjusted prices, Germany's standing timber value was estimated in a manner to reflect the actual value of the timber. Normally, immature trees are of lower value than mature ones. On the average, immature trees are smaller than mature timber, and smaller timber is typically converted into products of lower value and costs more per unit of volume to log and deliver to milling facilities. Unless the standing asset value is adjusted for these kinds of differences the net price method will overstate asset values relative to stumpage receipts30. Virtually every case study has made this kind of error with the apparent exception of Germany and Chile. Stumpage prices reflect the qualitative characteristics of the timber sold. Because the entire forest has timber which is growing and changing in its characteristics as it grows, it is typically not worth as much per unit of volume as timber which actually enters the market place. This point is sufficiently important to warrant a brief diversion into some basic timber economics. Timber has long been defined as a case of maturing assets. Timber appreciates for three basic and fundamental reasons. Timber grows so that standing physical capital accumulates with time. As timber grows, individual trees become larger. Large trees are worth more than small ones for two important reasons. There are fewer pieces of wood to handle per unit of timber volume so that logging, hauling, loading, unloading, sorting and sawing costs are less for larger logs than smaller ones. Furthermore, larger trees are typically converted into products of higher values. Lumber with larger dimensions, veneer products, and increasing amounts of wood with fewer (and sound) knots are all factors that help increase the value of wood per unit of volume as timber stands grow and appreciate. Furthermore, real wood product prices have increased around the world rather steadily since the end of World War II. This is the result of basic changes in scarcity. Thus if the average annual rate of timber growth is 2 to 3% over the life of a timber stand, its real rate of value growth typically far outstrips its physical growth rate. If forest sector accounts don't reflect these basic timber economic facts, the purposes of developing full benefit accounting for sustainable forestry and sustainable development are essentially defeated because of the false appearance that forests are a "bum" investment opportunity31. Another key valuation issue surrounds the treatment of forest maintenance and protection costs. If a forest is managed to produce multiple benefits there are really but two accounting alternatives. Preferably, the total value of all forest benefits must be compared with total management costs. If total benefits are not measured, it is perhaps prudent to develop some administrative rules to separate costs and allocate them various benefits produced. In this later way, the share of watershed protection would be allocated to a water resource account; a share would be allocated to an eco-tourism account and so forth32. For example, the countries assisted by UNSD, developed satellite accounts for timber but with the exception of the Philippines and Columbia, net timber flows were the only environmental forest benefit.
The experienced annual rate of return on forests lands and timber should be thought of as the sum of the forest income and the change in asset value divided by the sum of the land value plus the standing timber value. Clearly, if the numerator is erroneously high, the calculated rate of return will be erroneously low. A bum lamb is a problem lamb to the herdsmen. It is either an abandoned or orphaned lamb and typically must receive extra care if it is to survive. It is true that those who raise sheep and sell wool and mutton don't have to worry about separating feed costs to each product. From the point of view of national income accounting the case is interesting since one product is used in the textile industry and the other in the food industry so that the question of cost allocation is germane when it comes to value added calculations. Any approach to separability is arbitrary. Of course making social investment decisions in sheep may be arbitrary too if the price of wool or mutton does not reflect its' social value.
54 The Ghana case is in interesting one since it is acknowledged that many other forest benefits were excluded. Rather clearly, either the total forest benefits must be compared with the total forest costs, or some form of cost apportionment is in order. Another important valuation issue involves approaches to valuing forest land. Vincent and Hardwick (1997) approach this issue by essentially combining the capitalized value of the land in growing timber into the present value calculations of the timber itself. Any other forest land values would have to be based on other nontimber commodity land uses. Since the case studies in Australia, Brazil, Chile, and Zimbabwe apply the Vincent and Hardwick methodology, there is no attempt to add an extra value of forest land. The pilot studies under the direction of EUROSTAT hoped to develop a credible land value in the capital account balance sheets. They found that this form of value was lacking and recommend further studies to develop better estimates of these values. It would appear that if nations follow the Vincent and Hardwick approach to timber valuation, there is no need to add a capitalized value of the timber production growing rights to a separate land account. However, if people following this present value approach, have a separate land account, they should deduct the capitalized value of the infinite series of harvest (the land value in the Faustmann solution) from the rest of the forest land value. All of the above discussion of valuation essentially focused on what is typically assumed to be market resources. Of course economists typically assume that if a resource is classified as a market resource, there are no valuation problems. Having dispelled that myth, we now turn to a discussion of nonmarket resources and forest benefits recorded in other SNA sectors. Table 5Error! Reference source not found. and Table 6 in Chapter 3 make it clear how value added for forests must be conceived. If economies leave out important values, net value added calculations can be easily criticized. Several of the countries in the group that instituted forest sector accounts under the assistance of UNSD must get full benefit accounting to make value added estimates more meaningful. Thus far, the most through development of value estimates of nontimber forest products have been done in countries included in the EUROSTAT trials. These countries have the most advanced and progressive forest research organizations in the world. Finland, Sweden, and Germany also have very advanced forest products industries and have developed the best forest management information systems as well. These three countries, which are included in the EUROSTAT trials, are in the best positions to evaluate the total benefit contribution of nontimber forest values. Valuation issues for nonmarket environmental values remain troublesome. A reason is the macroeconomic or general equilibrium nature of the national income based policy analysis models. Since changes in outputs for entire industries are considered, it makes no sense to exclude consumers surplus for market goods and services and simultaneously includes it for market goods and services. Other approaches to valuation such as the environmental maintenance cost approach is also somewhat unconvincing because costs are being observed at output levels that would not rest in equilibrium if in fact markets were operating. 4.6.3 Experiences with Establishing Forest Sector Linkages.
The most through development of linkage estimates is found in the EUROSTAT experiences. Recalling that there were really three kind of linkages to be established in the first phase of their trials, they found some unexpected difficulties. First, they wanted to develop better linkages between woodland timber sources and wood conversion sectors. Here they found that differences in industry definitions and lack of harmonization hampered the accomplishment of these tasks. Second, they sought to develop better residuals flow linkages between wood and paper products wastes and broader pollution phenomenon. They appeared to be more successful at the product side of production than at the woodland.
55 side in these ventures. Finally, they hoped to link air pollution with forest degradation via defoliation losses. Here the initial success was very unconvincing. Only one country (Germany) could actually create the necessary cross-classifications in order to link these activities. Furthermore, none of the countries could trace the impact of air pollution activities on timber production itself. In fact, the disappointing results of these attempted linkages may mean that these efforts won't be continued in the future. Of course, if and when forest sector linkages are successfully implemented, several important analyses will be possible. Fundamental among these kinds of studies will be the estimation of total value added of all forest sector activities to total economy-wide activities. This will allow policy makers to make more informed judgments about budgets and other key policy decisions. A few studies hint at the importance of these ventures. For example, the Zimbabwe study suggests that the value of fuelwood in the economy is about 1 % of GNP. Another important example is Hulkrantz's (1992) Swedish study which estimated the value of carbon sequestering services along with fuelwood, berries, game and estimates of asset appreciation made a substantial difference in the calculated forest sector contribution to national well-being. These values by themselves increased total benefits by about one-third over more traditional estimates of value added. 4.6.4 Other Ecosystem Management Concerns.
Our discussion has thus far focused on the experiences surrounding physical flows, which may in principle be expressed as monetized accounts in forest sector natural resource accounting. But, of course, it was recognized at the outset that other forest sector benefits might not be monetized in national income accounting or in satellite accounting. Perhaps the clearest example of that lies with existence values since there is apparently no physical flow associated with the knowledge that something of value exists nor are there actual users or rights to use specific products or services. The classical case of this are the existence values associated with biodiversity. It was held that these values differ from indirect use values of biodiversity. These later values might be thought of as the values associated with maintaining a stable life support system. Many manifestations of these ecosystems management concerns are reflected in a variety of ways in SNAs and related satellite accounts. For example, some endangered species are not consumption goods. Their populations may be at risk as a result of habitat takings rather than population takings. They have no direct use values and there is no associated direct measure of annual economic activity. In some situations, forests could be removed from the base available for commodity exploitation as a means of protecting the species in question. This in turn could mean a reduction in the asset value of the forests without depletion. This falls under the discussion of the economic appearance and disappearance of an asset. The unfortunate aspect of national income accounting is that it makes these kinds of resource allocation decisions appear costless. Creation of protected habitat represents a reallocation of land in the nation's land account, and a redefinition of the nation's timber inventory in the sense that the timber inventory is an exploitable asset. Of course, the economic costs of these decisions lie in foregone exploitation since nothing is exchanged. All of these decisions can and often are made without explicit estimates of the value of the at-risk species. The implicit judgement, or perhaps better yet, the revealed minimum value of the protected species lies in its' foregone values. At the same time, however, the forests presumably continue to take up carbon, provide water products and recreational services and may also continue to yield other nonwood products. To sum it all up, it may be necessary to have some capital accounts that are not directly associated with flow accounts.
56 The Criteria and Indicators are another interesting case in point. Here, would seem to be a case of essentially physical accounts (both stock and flow) which are not monetized. The purpose of these accounts is to give a far broader view of sustainability, but without a numerairre or unit of value which would allow broader welfare interpretation of environmental, social and economic trends. While the existence of Criteria and Indicators will allow policy makers to see positive and negative trends in key indicators of sustainable development, it remains to be seen how the absence of an unambiguous index of biodiversity will influence their social utility. 4.6.5 Sustainable-Yield, Sustainable Forestry, Sustainable Development and Environmental Accounting.
Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of all of the trials, case studies and country experiences are found in contrasting approaches to sustainable development. This point is brought forward most provocatively in comparing some of the results of the FAO/World Bank commissioned studies with the UNSD country experiences. Recall that the UNSD approach to sustainability is one where depletion only occurs when the level of harvest exceeds a calculated allowable cut. The approach followed under the FAO/World Bank studies was more traditional in the historical sense of balancing growth with harvests. For example, the Brazilian study concluded that current harvest levels couldn't be sustained and that the problem was most readily apparent in Mahogany. In contrast, using the UNSD approach to sustainability, no conclusions were reached about the sustainability of harvests in Ghana precisely because no level of harvest was calculated. Under the UNSD system of "hard sustainability" there is no depletion until calculated sustainable harvests have been exceeded. Forest economists familiar with mathematical routines used in calculating allowable cuts will readily recognize many weaknesses in the UNSD approach. The UNSD approach may indicate depletion when there is actual capital accumulation33. Likewise, substantial depletion may occur and go unnoticed using the UNSD definition of sustainability34. In developing national income accounting methods and practices which are broadly useful, it must be remembered that the audience of potential users will come from a variety of sustainability contexts. The origins of sustained yield, while essentially concerned with long term capital management viewed the problem from the perspective of managing the inventory of physical capital. In contrast, economists who view sustainable development as being a problem of the long-term accumulation of broadly defined wealth are convinced of the necessity of monetizing all environmental assets. The recent sustainable forestry perspective sees the problem as one of striking a balance in the mix of forest uses without the necessity of valuing all environmental assets because the problem is really one of trying to balance conflicting political interests. In a sense, the physical inventory and flow accounts are of greatest interest to sustained yield forestry advocates. The capital assets and monetized flow accounts are of greatest interest to the sustainable capital accumulation.
Three simple examples come to mind. Forest management may result in the gradual accumulation of a higher proportion of more valuable species. Forest management may result in the accumulation of higher quality wood. Real timber prices will likely to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. All of these values may more than counterbalance a harvest that exceeds a calculated ceiling harvest. Three reasons readily come to mind again. Obviously, over-cutting may occur with or without a calculated sustainable harvest. Second, sustainable harvest calculations are based in part on assumptions about how much will be spent augmenting timber growth both in current and future periods of time. Often even the best-intended assumptions are laid to rest. The result would be unrealizable annual allowable cuts. Finally, forest depletion could go unnoticed if all of the most valuable timber was being removed and replaced by fast-growing "junk wood".
57 school while the Criteria and Indicators are based from the perspective of sustainable forestry and are likely to be of greatest interest to advocates of this school of thought. It may be impossible to both monetize all aspects of the Criteria and Indicators and link them to other activities in the forest sector. This should not preclude their being included in satellite accounts. Economists have long worked under the simplifying macroeconomic assumption of a homogenous physical stock of capital. This assumption has absolutely no empirical content yet remains a useful concept in macroeconomic modeling. Criteria and Indicators are an attempt to capture many of the non-additive components of the collective concept of sustainable forestry. They should not be dismissed because they don't behave like standard accounting transactions. 4.7 Policy Recommendations.
Having focused the report on a description of forest sector environmental and economic accounts coupled with attention to their prospects, experience and use to date, it is now important to turn a proposed set of priority actions. · · · · · · · · · · · Support resource inventory efforts including the introduction of new technologies such as GIS. Support development of household surveys of nonwood forest products consumption. In some countries these surveys might be included in the periodic census of population. Develop key approaches for resource valuation of non-exchanged direct use values consistent with general equilibrium models. Support ventures into proper estimation of timber asset values where institutional arrangements create inaccurate value estimates. Support the development of methodology to estimate forest land prices. Work with agencies to develop criteria and indicators. Help develop and make available computer based analytical models that will utilize the environmental account information in policy analysis. Support the development of production flows, monetized values and sector linkages for countries where nontimber forest products are important yet unappreciated. Improve the transfer of know-how between EUROSTAT and countries with comparative rich experiences in environmental accounting in the forest sector to other less experienced countries. Create effective transfers of knowledge concerning sustainable wealth and sustainable forestry at high levels of policy and public information by hosting major workshops for the press. Avoid hardwired dogmatic approaches to sustainability. There is a variety of alternative sustainability "schools of thought" and there is considerable flux in what is the right approach. Develop accounting systems that can be applied to a variety of approaches to sustainability. Training Needs/Capacity Building.
Creating good forest sector accounts requires teams of people with a variety of backgrounds and experiences. Satellite accounts should be developed so that they are integrated into, and an extension of the SNA. Rather clearly, people with national income accounting training should be intimately involved as team members. There is a lot of specialized technical knowledge surrounding the management and use of forests. Language is specialized and the production relationships are also complex. Forest economists should be extraordinarily valuable team members as we. Beyond this, there is an increasing set of complex biological.
58 issues concerning the existence and use of forests. Finally, it is clear that existing data and information sources are typically inadequate. Teams should have ready access to expertise in such subjects as timber inventory measurements, and household surveys. A good systems ecologist could also be a very important member of a forest account development team. Some countries may have these to enhance these capacities.

This study applies distinct methodological forest accounting approaches, following Vincent and Hartwick (1997) lines, to estimate economic depreciation of timber exploitation in the Amazonian region. Although our results may be not definitive ones due to data availability problems, this exercise has proved to bring about issues which, though are theoretical and methodologically fully recognised, are not always revealed in other regional studies. High timber stocks, lack of property rights and informal economic relations are issues related to the Amazonian case that require great deal of caution when one is applying economic depreciation methodologies, as will be addressed on the basis of our results.
INTRODUCTION.
This study is part of an international project undertaken by the Forestry Department at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and The World Bank. It aims at the application of forestry accounting in distinct regional scenarios. Apart from Brazil, studies were also performed in Australia, Chile, Philippines and Zimbabwe. To do so, methodological lines were set up in a background paper by Vincent and Hartwick (1997), carefully briefed and commented by distinguish experts and here denominated as V&H (1997). The Brazilian case was selected to be applied in the Amazonian context. That choice was justified on the basis of the wide recognised importance of the region in ecological terms as well as its increasing economic relevance since it currently generates more than 70% of the total round wood produced in Brazil. That choice was not taken however without considering the data availability problems since it will be requiring information which is usually difficult to find even in forestry activities taking place in modern economic scenarios. The open access features of the Amazonian context is by nature one of lack of institutional enforcement, proper managerial practices and, consequently, fragile information systems. We have made the most of data availability, even though, some generalizations have been necessary. Bearing that in mind, our results will need to be seen under this perspective. On the other hand, the application of depreciation estimation methodologies in that Amazonian context has proved to bring about issues which, though are theoretical and methodologically fully recognized, are not always revealed in other regional exercises. High timber stocks, lack of property rights and informal economic relations, are issues that require great deal of caution when one is applying economic depreciation methodologies. We hope that in addressing them, we have attached a greater value added to this methodological exercise. Previous estimates for natural capital depreciation in Brazil faced the same data barriers, particularly in forest accounts for which estimate values with 1985 as the closing year1 were used. Apart from being more comprehensive in methodological procedures, our study was able to rely on recent survey data and cover the 1990/95 period which can capture the dramatic deforestation process and the radical increase in timber production started in the late eighties. Whatever the context, environmental accounting faces theoretical and methodological controversies. Even though sustainability principles can explain methodological differences,2 some theoretical issues, such as appropriate discounting and dynamic optimal behaviour, play an important role. This study will attempt to address these issues on the lines of V&H (1997) to the Brazilian Amazon. Section 2 presents an overview of the forest conversion pattern in the Brazilian Amazon and its relationship to the local timber exploitation activity. Following H&V (1997), methodological.
See Seroa da Motta (1995) for a general view of these studies and Seroa da Motta and May (1995) for the particular case of forests. It should be noted that the user cost approach was employed with sustainable output rather than net profit measures. 2 See, for example, Atkinson et alii (1997) and Seroa da Motta (1993).
2 approaches are presented in the following section. Due to the Amazonian context, property right enforcement issues are analysed in Section.
The following section describes our estimation procedures and analyses the results. The last section offers additional comments in the appropriateness of forest accounting in the Brazilian Amazon and raises some questions related to its usefulness for environmental planning in the region.
FOREST CONVERSION PATTERN IN THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON.
Socio-Economic Factors.
Preservation in Brazil is legally set in the Forest Code and water legislation basically by restricting land-uses. The Forest Code, published in 1934 and revised in 1965, regulates the use of wood from forests, defines conservation units, restricts farming and logging activities, set criteria for burning and chainsaw uses and states sanctions and fines. At the same time, water legislation, due to the need to protect watershed mainly for domestic supply, introduced very strict rules and norms for land uses to preserve forest areas at river basins. Despite the severity of these regulations, forest clearing at large scale has not been avoided in Brazil. No more than 8% of the Atlantic Forest, previously located over the most developed areas of the country, is left standing. The area of the Savannahs of Cerrados, in the central region, has been already cleared in half of its original size for farming purposes. Although less than 10% of the Amazon Forests has been cleared, the annual deforestation rate is still very high.3 Sustainable management practices for logging are already incorporated in the Brazilian environmental regulation. However, they do not succeed since abundant wood supply is available from agricultural expansion and lack of monitoring in such large areas. Nevertheless, even with the introduction of sustainable criteria to agricultural practices, forest clearing will continue to be a major source of wood supply while governmental agencies fail to deter illegal clearing. Forest land conversion is the main driving economic force on forest use. Therefore, the process of privatization of forest and its land, accomplished by assigning private individual rights based on clearing for further titling, has been very harmful for sustainable purposes in the region. Although a retreat on this driving force could be expected with the recent land taxation law, which offers exemptions for forestry and forest conservation, its enforcement may take several years to be fully implemented. Summing up, deforestation in Brazil is driven mainly by agricultural and logging activities. The expansion of these activities into open access areas has been very active despite legal restrictions. Apart from institutional fragility to enforce norms and rules, deforestation of important ecosystems is also a result of several economic factors, namely: a) A highly concentrated land tenure system where small farms (less than 10 ha) cover less than 3% of the total farming area while the share of large farms (more than 10,000 ha) represents above 40%. Additionally, agriculture in Brazil still presents very low average productivity levels per unit of area which acts as a push factor for continuous forest clearance. b) Personal income is also highly concentrated with 66.1% of the total income accruing to the 20% richest families while just 2.3% accrues to the 20% of the poorest ones [Bonelli and Ramos (1993)]. Such inequality creates an immense surplus of lowincome workers ready to seek occupations in frontier areas. c) Favourable credit and fiscal system to agricultural activities with no regard to soil agroecological features and managerial practices which resulted in a mere.
See Seroa da Motta (1997) for detailed indicators on deforestation in Brazil and their respective analysis.
4 replication of agricultural technologies already in place in areas with distinct ecological conditions. d) And finally, regional development programmes in frontier areas, though are nowadays mostly phased out, have immensely contributed to stimulate economic activities and promote migration flows. Some of these factors cannot be easily reverted since it would require long-term structural adjustments to alleviate social inequalities, accomplish a satisfactory land reform and even create the proper incentives and enhance human resource's capacity in governmental agencies. 2.2 Open Access Features.
As it was mentioned previously, one of the most important characteristics of the Brazilian Amazon is its open access feature. It is very important to understand the peculiar characteristics that allow agricultural peasants and timber loggers to penetrate the forest clearing it without any concern about resource scarcity and its economic consequences. Some of these peculiarities are presented below: · Land titling of a property is based on land productive use, such as area allocated to farming. Only very recently has legislation on land taxes been changed4 to consider standing forest legally recognized as productive use. Therefore, land titling and taxation have not only legalized clearing, but encouraged it. Forest land conversion to agriculture in the Amazonian region used to be allowed for up to 50% of the farm area. This percentage has been reduced to 20% in 1996 but with no effective enforcement so far. This legal clearing percentage has been used to issue conversion (clearing) permits and has become the main source of timber exploitation. Forestry activities, in fact, are financing forest clearing since extraction for this purpose is legal. Property rights for standing forests can only be viable with high enforcement costs. Illegal logging has, nevertheless, always been possible since no man-based regulation can be effective in such an enormous area as the Brazilian Amazon (western Europe size), particularly considering the existing social pressure and institutional fragility. It is known that sawmills are exploring areas where agricultural activities have not arrived due to the lack of infrastructure, consequently, the partnership between agriculture and sawmills will soon lead to other fronts of clearing. The Amazonian timber extraction process is characterized by a formal sector that works "by the books" with high costs and an informal sector working "freely" with low costs. This dual market structure is not economically feasible in such enormous area where outputs are not differentiated to receive compensatory higher prices. Amazonian forest is more heterogeneous and grows at lower rates than any other forest. Consequently, standing trees in this forest create low private values. Not only extraction costs increases as well as wood market shrinks to accommodate various species. Creaming is unavoidable without proper economic incentives. Heterogeneity in this case is on tree species as well as on tree incidence in different areas.
The new land taxation rules will be effective only in 1997.
Apart from that, states in Brazil are allowed to have their own state forestry policy and they usually have enough power to use parliamentary forces to curb centralised governmental protection measures in the region. Loggers and farmers are very politically "persuasive" in these states.
Based on these points, it has been claimed that forestry in the region is not undertaken with fully enforceable property rights. In other words, logging is carried out without proper account for scarcity parameters in a quasi-open access case,5 as will be further developed. 2.3 Logging Activity Outline.
As can be observed in Table 1, Amazonian wood output share in the national production increased from 40.5% in 1980 to 75% in 1991. Although more up-to-date figures are not available, this impressive expansion in the analysed period clearly reveals the growing importance of Amazonian wood species in logging activities. Moreover, it is estimated that in the last ten years no more than 10% of the logging output is exported and its composition concentrated in few species, particularly mahogany which accounts alone for 50% of the total export value. Table 1.

Round Wood Production in Brazil.
The importance of logging expansion in the deforestation process can be observed in Table.
Estimates of effective and potential wood commercial production from agricultural cleared areas6 in the Amazonian region are presented for the period 1975/91 also based on Prado (1995). Effective production is the wood output currently generated and potential production is an estimate of the wood output which could be generated from cleared areas. The ratio of these two output values offers a good indicator of how much wood extraction is taking place as a consequence of the clearing for agricultural purposes. From Table 2 one may note that ratio values increased from 13% in 1975 to 95% in 1991. That is, wood extraction is currently strongly associated to clearing for agricultural purposes. Thus we have a circular relationship where wood extraction revenues finance clearing and legal licenses granted for agricultural clearing legalize wood extraction. This synergy generates private economic values to deforested lands much higher than those which could be derived from either preservation activities or sustainable agroforestry.
See, for example, Young (1997) for a discussion on this matter and Seroa da Motta (1997) for more details on property right's assignment in the region. 6 Cleared areas are those observed in the period and include legal and illegal clearing.
Field surveys in traditional logging Amazonian areas presented in Almeida and Uhl (1995), estimated financial rates of return higher than 300% for wood extraction and processing activities with logging undertaken in rented lands (i.e., land for agricultural clearing). If supply of wood comes from sustainable logging undertaken in lands only devoted for logging activities, rates of return would drop to almost 20%. That is, saw-milling activities can count on low-cost legal and illegal supply of wood which allows for very profitable financial returns to which sustainable logging cannot compete.

This association was also observed for the past in the Atlantic Forest. In fact, logging activities in Brazil are still mostly relying on native forests from which more than 75% of round wood is produced. Summing up, attempts to estimate timber depreciation in the Amazon have to take three regional features into account: a) the remaining size of the forest is still almost 90% of the original area despite the continuous deforestation process in the region; b) property rights are assigned by clearing which generates a continuous flow of timber output with the frontier advancement; and c) the association of agriculture expansion and logging exploitation seems to perpetuate the low capital and informal profile of forestry in the region. That is, large areas open for exploitation, fragile property rights and informal market structure are key factors preventing economic agent's perception of scarcity in the region.
ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING THE DEPRECIATION OF NATURAL CAPITAL.
Adjustment in National Accounts.
Literature on depreciation accounting procedures of natural resource exhaustion is still open to debate about the most appropriate method.7 Economic progress has been measured in almost every nation world-wide by the system of national accounts using the Gross National Product (GNP). It uses market prices to measure the aggregate value of an economy's output in a given year. Despite being the most used indicator of economic progress, it is widely known that GNP is a very poor approximation of economic well being. Another indicator, Net National Product (NNP), is a much better measure of well being because it accounts for the depreciation of the wealth of a country. Man-made capital for example, depreciates through time and this loss in value is captured in the NNP measure. Nonetheless NNP, in its traditional measure, only takes into account the losses of man made capital, leaving aside the depreciation of natural capital.8 This depreciation happens when the stock of a natural resource is decreased. The idea of adjusting the system of national accounts to incorporate the losses due to the use of natural resources, is closely related to the concept of sustainability as an indicator of sustainable development.9 Although there are many definitions of sustainable development, economic definitions have focused on sustainable development as non-declining per capita welfare over time [Pearce and Atkinson, (1995)]. The idea behind it is that every future generation must have the option of being at least as well off as its predecessor. Hence a sustainable path has the characteristic that along it, the overall productive capacity of an economy is not reduced.10 The productive capacity of an economy depends on the total stock of capital available, as well as on its productivity. If some capital is used up and not replaced, the possibilities of future production is decreased. This is not so much of an issue with physical capital, since it can be produced and replaced. Nevertheless, it is an issue with natural capital which cannot be created by mankind. Therefore, when natural resources are used up or destroyed, there is implicitly a question of substitution. The question to ask is, at each point in time, how much of the natural capital productive base can be used up? The answer given by economic theory is based on two different approaches developed in a parallel way and yielding theoretically equivalent results. Both aim at measuring the impacts of resource depletion on long run human welfare, but while they are equivalent in theory, they will not yield necessarily the same result in practice.11.
Despite the continuous efforts of the UN Statistical Office to harmonize procedures, exhaustion accounting method is still without proper guidance. See for example Bartelmus (1996). 8 It also leaves aside the depreciation of human capital. UN Statistical Office efforts on environmental accounting are aimed at correcting this omission. 9 These adjustments should be broader than just calculating the depreciation of timber caused by deforestation, as we are doing in the present paper. They should include other factors that can affect the value of a forest and its land. Nevertheless these adjustments were out of the scope of the present study, although very important. 10 Although sustainability and sustainable development are related concepts, they are not synonyms. Sustainable development is a much more vague concept that is commonly used in many contexts without a proper definition. 11 For the importance of sustainability principles in environmental accounting, see, for example, Seroa da Motta (1994).
8 The first approach was derived in Hartwick (1977). He showed that so long as the capital stock of an economy did not decline over time, non-declining consumption was possible. We can illustrate Hartwick's idea with a simple economy consisting of two types of capital: physical and natural capital denoted by Kt and Rt, respectively. The net investment in this economy is given by the gross investment minus the depreciation in each of the form of capital: I tN = dK t dt + dRt dt . If the net investment is greater than or equal to zero, the country can at least sustain its actual consumption level. If this country produces a nonrenewable resource, non-declining consumption is possible by reinvesting all Hotelling rents from the exhaustible resource in physical capital. These rents are those resulting from an intertemporal efficient extraction programme. This is what is known in the literature as the Hartwick rule. It tell us the amount that we have to invest in other forms of capital when we extract a natural resource and earn rents on it. It was shown by Solow (1986) that it also represents a requirement to "keep capital intact". There are two important assumptions implicit in Hartwick's result. First, physical capital and natural capital are assumed to be close substitutes.12 Second, the model assumes that an individual only derives utility from the consumption of goods and not directly from the environment. The second approach was developed from the work of Weitzman (1976) on Net Domestic Product (NDP). We can define NDP for an economy with balanced trade13 as, NDPt = Ct + I tN . Weitzman (1976) demonstrated that under optimal growth, NDP should be though of as income in the Hicksian sense14 interpreted as a long run measure of economic well-being, that is, the stationary equivalent of future consumption. In this sense, national wealth for a country would be given by the present value of the best consumption path into the future that society can afford.15 Weitzman proved that Net National Product (NNP) in any year t is equal to the discount rate (social rate of time preference)16 multiplied by wealth: NNP(t)= W(t). Based on this result, he argued that a true measure of NDP should include the value of changes in resource stocks. Consequently, the net investment should be defined taking into account the depreciation in all types of capital, not only physical. Weitzman (1976) result depends on two crucial assumptions: first that a country growth path is optimal and second that social welfare equals consumption.
The elasticity of substitution is equal to one. Exports equal imports. 14 Income defined as the dollar flow which could be consumed from wealth or capital while leaving wealth undiminished.
This can be defined formally as W (t ) =.
C * ( s)e -  ( s- t ) ds , where  is the discount rate.
In this model,  equals the marginal product of capital (interest rate) only under steady state growth and zero population growth.
9 In both of the approaches presented above, we need an estimate of the depreciation of natural capital in order to subtract it from the value of the capital stock. In this manner we would adjust the gross investment to net investment. For an exhaustible resource, Hartwick and Hageman (1993) define depreciation as the change in value of an exhaustible resource under optimal use. If optimality conditions do not hold and substitution possibilities between physical capital and natural capital are restricted, then, the above approaches face criticisms on the basis of sustainability views. These approaches are regarded as based on the weak sustainability principle which sustains that natural capital can be permanently substituted by physical capital. Consequently, when natural resources are extracted, we can set aside part of its revenue to invest in physical capital and maintain intact the economy's productive capacity. This idea is not widely accepted. For some natural resources serving as production factors, there could be thresholds, carrying or assimilative capacity, causing some types of natural capital to be hardly substitutable. Many assets are essential to human being survival in the long run and this point of view is expressed in the strong sustainability concept, based on the conservation of many types of natural capital (i.e. maintaining them intact for future generations) or recognition of their safe minimum standards. Although depreciation methods can be analysed along these sustainability principles,17 the proposed depreciation methodologies can be generalized as elaborated in V&H (1997) and summarized in the following sub-sections. 3.2 The Change in Value Method.
Depreciation of an asset over a period of time can be calculated as the value of the asset in the beginning of the period minus the value of the same asset in the end of the period. This method is known as the change in value method. Adopting the definition of income as the level of consumption that could be enjoyed without diminishing the capital stock, we can define depreciation as the consumption of the assets in excess of this amount. More formally, depreciation exists when there is degradation of a resource. If we have the value of a resource at the end of a period and the value at the beginning of the period, we can calculate the depreciation of the resource as the difference between the two values.18 Defining the value of a resource as the discounted sum of the resource rents that are generated over time19 and using some algebraic manipulation, we can express the depreciation of an asset as:20.
D(t ) = iV (t + 1) / (1 + i ) - [ pq (t ) - C (q (t ))].
See Atkinson et alii (1997) and Seroa da Motta (1994). Mathematically D(t ) = V (t + 1) - V (t ). 19 If the resource is non-renewable and using discrete time, we can express the asset value at time t by V ( t ) =.
(1 + i ) t - s [ pq ( s) - C (q ( s))] ; where p is the price of one unit of the extracted resource.
(constant over time), q(s) is the quantity extracted at period t, C(q(s)) is the total cost of extraction and T is the period when the resource is exhausted. Expression pq ( s) - C (q ( s)) represents the current resource rent.
Alternatively in continuous time V = rV (t ) - [ pq (t ) - C (q (t ))] .
The previous expression is known as the fundamental equation of asset equilibrium. Although in theory it is a good representation for the depreciation of an asset, carrying out the previous calculation in practice has many complications. We would need projection of the future flow of rents, in which case we need prices, quantities extracted and cost schedules into a future finite stream. 3.3 Total Hotelling Rent as Depreciation.
Hotelling rent (HR) is defined as the rent that exists on the marginal quantity of an exhaustible resource (price minus marginal cost) and it is considered a measure of the intertemporal scarcity of that resource. This rent exists because the resource is exhaustible and consequently, the owners of the resource extract less than the amount that would equate marginal revenue to marginal cost. Multiplying the HR by the quantity extracted of the resource, gives the total Hotelling rent. It is interpreted as the portion of profit that accrue to extractive firms because they are mining an exhaustible resource. Hartwick (1988) proved that along dynamically efficient paths of extraction, Hotelling rent and economic depreciation (with a negative sign) are equals. Using this result, it is possible to use a short cut to calculate economic depreciation. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this equivalence is only correct under certain conditions, namely: a) resource extracted optimally, i.e., Hotelling's rule holds; b) price of extracted resource constant over time; c) marginal cost as an increasing function of the amount extracted, unrelated to the size of the reserve and constant over time; and d) constant discount rate over time. 3.4 The Net Price Method (NPM).
As it was mentioned previously, under special conditions, economic depreciation of natural resources can be approximated by the Hotelling rent. This last term was defined as price minus marginal extraction cost (the profit on the marginal ton extracted), multiplied by the amount extracted. Hence we can use the following expression to calculate the depreciation of natural capital from the NPM:.
In theory this method would be easier to apply than the change on value method. Nevertheless in practice, the data on marginal extraction cost is not generally available. Consequently previous studies that attempted to calculate depreciation of natural capital used the so called net price method. It uses data on average cost instead of marginal cost and calculates the depreciation as:.
11 It is important to note that, as it was mentioned by several authors,21 using the average net price instead of the marginal net price, one is calculating the total resource rent which overstates net accumulation (unless the MC=AC as in the case of a linear cost function). 3.5 The El Serafy Method (ESM).
Alternatively to the net price method, El Serafy (1989) developed a method to calculate depreciation based on the concept of user cost. He equates the finite stream of rents earned by a resource to an annuity X earned forever, which can be obtained by selling the mine and depositing the value of the mine (V) in a bank account. Mathematically this is given by:.
Rt + [1 / (1 + r )]Rt +1 +. . .+[1 / (1 + r ) n ]Rt + n = X + [1 / (1 + r )] X +. . .+[1 / (1 + r )  ] X (4).
where r is the discount rate, n+t is the last year of the extraction, X is the annuity received and R is the rent defined as Rt = pt q t - C ( q t ) . The expression R-X is a measure of depreciation, and El Serafy (1989) simplifies further the analysis to obtain a closed form solution. Assuming that the rent is constant over time,22 such that Rt = Rt +1 =. . . = Rt + n , the equation above is simplifies to:.
The previous expression is the user cost or economic depreciation for the ESM. It is important to note that as Hartwick and Hageman (1993) pointed out, if R(t) changes over time, the measure R-X could be a poor approximation to R(t+i)-X in period i, consequently the ESM would yield a poor approximation of the depreciation value. In the ESM, n is the remaining years of life of the resource stock. This is estimated by dividing total reserves remaining by the year's quantity extracted. This calculation implicitly assumes that this year's extraction will continue into the future at the same rate. If S(t) is the remaining stock of the resource at period t and q(t) the quantity extracted of the resource in the same period, we can express ESM formula to estimate depreciation as:.
D(t ) = -[ pq (t ) - C (q (t ))][1 / (1 + r ) S ( t ) q ( t ) -1 ].
See, for example, Hartwick and Hageman (1993), Seroa da Motta (1994) and Atkinson et alii (1997) for criticisms on these lines. 22 That is, current rent is assumed constant to estimate user cost values in a specific year, although rent can vary each year for which user cost is estimated.
Vincent and Hartwick Approach.
Vincent and Hartwick (1997) suggested a transformation applied to the average cost in order to get a consistent estimate of depreciation. If the marginal cost curve is isoelastic in the quantity extracted and assuming a functional form for the total extraction cost as C (q (t )) = q (t ) 1+  (1 +  ) they show that MC=(1+)AC. Therefore we can express the expression for the Hotelling as:.
Where  is the elasticity of the marginal cost curve with respect to the quantity extracted. It is important to note that on the previous formula, for relative elastic marginal cost curves (1), unit price has to be at least twice as large as the unit average cost. Otherwise, one would witness a negative estimate of depreciation which would not make economic sense in presence of increasing depletion. This arithmetical trap is only due to the simplification of the isoelastic assumption of the marginal cost curve. Another approach used by Vincent (1997), is to use the previous total cost function and the fact that under an optimal extraction path, the transversality condition implies that MC=AC when the resource is exhausted. As a result, it is shown that for the previous functional form, this transversality condition occurs if and only if q(t)=MC=AC=0 in the final period. Using the Hotelling rule and the fact that MC(T)=0, Vincent (1997) derives the following expression for the Hotelling rent:.
D(t ) = -[ pq (t ) - C (q (t ))](1 +  ) / [1 +  (1 + i ) S ( t ) / q ( t ) -1 ].
The previous expression is a generalization of the net price and El Serafy methods in the sense that it embodies both estimations as particular cases. If    , equation (8) simplifies to the ESM and If   0 , the whole right hand side goes away and the Hotelling rent would just equal the total rent. The usefulness of the previous formula is that in practice it is much easier to find data available for the average cost than for the marginal cost. However, estimating  can be a practical complication. Obviously the elasticity of marginal cost will vary depending on the nature of the resource (timber, oil, etc.) and type of industries.23 Equations (7) and (8) are presented by Hartwick and Vincent (1997) as being equivalent. The choice of which one to use depends just on the availability of data. If data is obtainable on the average extraction cost, then one can use expression (7) to estimate the depreciation. If instead, data is available on the resource rent, Vincent (1997) has demonstrated that expression (8) is an alternative measure of the Hotelling rent. Nevertheless it is noted in.
Apart from being difficult to estimate, this function may vary over time and over place. Therefore, such mathematical simplification may loose economic meaning for prediction purposes. We thank this point to Salah El Serafy.
13 Vincent (1997) that expression (7) would yield less accurate estimates of economic depreciation than formula (8). This would happen due to the fact that formula (7) is based on current marginal rent and, on the other hand, expression (8) is based on long run principles. Although Vincent (1997) is correct in his concern for estimating long run instead of short run Hotelling rents, it is not clear in his argument why the formula from expression (8) would take into account out of equilibrium behaviour in the timber market. Since it also uses current price and costs of logged wood, any tendency of resource prices to fluctuate in the short run will be incorporated into his estimates using expression (8) as well as expression (7). Moreover, since expression (8) incorporates a discount rate and formula (7) does not, any bias caused by fluctuation in prices could be compensated by biases caused by the choice of an incorrect discount rate. Consequently, it does not seem to exist any a priori reason why biases in the discount rate chosen would not be even worse than biases from price fluctuations or out of the equilibrium behaviour in timber markets. In spite of previous points, our estimates of depreciation values will follow equation (8) and we will be assuming additionally permanent conversion of forest land to agriculture purposes. This would imply that we will not be considering any form of reforestation or second growth forest conversion.
THE ECONOMICS OF TIMBER EXPLOITATION IN OPEN ACCESS REGIMES.
Forests are usually characterized in the literature as renewable resources. Nevertheless, the overexploitation of forests can lead to its exhaustion. If the rate of harvest exceeds the annual natural growth rate, forests are going to be exhausted since the extraction pattern is unsustainable. In this case, timber exploitation can be treated equivalently as non-renewable resources. A special case of the previous situation occurs when timber is extracted and the land is permanently converted for agriculture and cattle rising. This is very much, as discussed previously, the case of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.24 As it is well known, natural resources differently from other kind of produced goods, do not dissipate the producer surplus by competition in the long run. The rents associated with a natural resource will generally have two components: one static and the other dynamic. The static part of the rent is called the differential or Ricardian rent. It is defined as the excess of the market value of supramarginal units of natural resources over current scarcity rents. It is analogous to the Ricardian "diminishing returns" and it is viewed as a static surplus. These natural resource rents arise from heterogeneity in land quality (in this case, differences in the quality of natural resources) and are not related to time. Hence if exhaustible resources are heterogeneous, part of the rent is a differential or Ricardian rent. The dynamic component of the total rent, the scarcity or Hotelling rent, is related to the characteristics of exhaustible resources. Scarcity creates economic rents that are captured by the owner of the resource if property rights are well defined. These rents generated by a natural resource are closely related to the concept of user cost. The user cost is the present value of all future sacrifices associated with the use of a particular unit of a natural resource in the present. Since any unit consumed today is lost for future use, the present extraction and consumption of the resource implies an opportunity cost, the value that might be obtained from this resource in the future. Allocating the resource efficiently over time will imply extracting and selling a quantity that is lower than the one equating price to marginal cost. This difference between the marginal cost schedule and the price is the user cost. The scarcity rent can be defined as the user cost of the marginal unit being extracted at any point in time. In other words, it is the payment accruing to a natural resource owner when the user cost is positive. This is a forward-looking concept in the sense that it should anticipate future increases in demand and changes in extraction costs. Developing country's natural resources are usually characterized by the weak definition of property rights, with numerous of them being characterized by an open access regime.25 When perfectly defined property rights exist and given other regularity conditions,26 agents exploiting resources will take into account the user cost and will maximise profits efficiently in a dynamic sense. However, if property rights are not well defined, economic agents will not take future scarcity into account in their maximization decision. In this situation, the existence of positive rents is no longer guaranteed and scarcity rents will generally be driven to zero.27.
For a formal treatment of virgin forests as non-renewable resources, see Vincent (1997, p.30). We include in the open access resource definition situations where property rights over natural resources are defined by law, but there is no enforcement or monitoring over them. 26 The definition of property rights is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for efficient exploitation of a natural resource. See Dasgupta and Heal (1979) for a formal treatment on necessary and sufficient conditions for efficient exploitation of natural resources. 27 See the appendix for a simple model illustrating this situation.
16 Under an open access regime, economic agents will simply decide to enter the exploitation of the resource based on a comparison between the cost of entrance and the expected income they will get from the activity. If the net expected benefit from the activity is positive, they will always decide to enter and exploit the natural resource. The problem with this result is that the private evaluation of net benefits is different from the social evaluation. An economic agent deciding to exploit a given resource will not take into account the fall in other agent's income that is caused by his entrance. Hence, a negative externality is imposed on other economic agents. The intuition behind this result is that each agent acts under the assumption that there is no use foregoing some harvest today in the interests of having reasonably sized stock tomorrow because if he does so, the resource will be caught by another agent tomorrow since entry is "free" [Hartwick (1980)]. Therefore, in an open access situation, the economic agent will not be compensated by the market from restraining his harvest in the present in benefit of future gains. As Hanna et alii (1995) point out: "Under a regime of open access, claims to resources are realized at the point of capture, and owners have no specified duty to maintain the resource or constrain its use". Nevertheless, it is important to note that open access does not necessarily imply unlimited harvest of resources since there is always a cost to extraction. Also, according to Hanna et alii (1995), property rights regimes must perform certain functions such as limiting use, co-ordinate users and respond to changing environmental conditions. These activities involve transaction costs of co-ordination, information gathering, monitoring and enforcement. The transaction costs are influenced by the particular structure and context of the property rights regime and the conditions of the ecological system. These costs are therefore a function of the amount of agents to be coordinated, the area over which the monitoring and enforcement is going to take place and the amount of information needed. It is well known that observed market prices only reflect scarcity when there are no market failures in the economy. The clear definition and enforcement of property rights are basic assumptions in the calculation of changes in values of natural resources stocks. Hartwick (1991) makes explicitly clear that one of the basic assumptions of his results is that property rights are well defined and universal. Not enforceable property rights imply an inefficiently low shadow price on the stock of the resource causing rents to be dissipated. Scarcity rents will be decreased and taken to zero in the extreme case of complete open access. The Brazilian Amazon seems to be characterized by an intermediate case between private property and open access. Although property rights are not defined ex-ante in the frontier and beyond it, there are some stipulated mechanisms of getting property rights over deforested land.28 During many years, this colonization pattern caused a race for new land motivated by speculative motives. Economic agents would move to the frontier, clear the land, start an agriculture or cattle raising activity and then wait to get the title for the land. Therefore, ex-post, property rights were defined assuring the economic agent with a stream of benefits into the future. This pattern explains why the race towards the frontier in the Amazon cannot be characterized as a pure open access situation.29 The implications of the quasi-open access situation to the calculation of economic depreciation are very important. Since the extraction of the resource is not optimal, Hotelling rule does not hold. The resource is going to be extracted faster than it would have been under an optimal situation. Since the equivalence between depreciation and Hotelling rent.
Refer to the first part of this paper and Schneider (1995) for an explanation of such mechanisms. For a model on this process, see Young (1997). He characterizes this type of property right regime as quasi-open access.
17 depends on the Hotelling rule, this will also break down. Part of the scarcity or Hotelling rent will be dissipated, so depreciation will appear to be lower than actually is. Using the definition of Hartwick and Hageman (1993), depreciation is the change in the value of an exhaustible resource under optimal use. Since the value is calculated using the present value of all the expected net revenues from the stock, it will be lower under incomplete property rights. There will be an intertemporal externality, namely an agent extracting timber will adjust its harvest until the current marginal cost equal the current discounted average payoff and not the marginal payoff. Since the average payoff is lower than the marginal payoff, the discounted value will also be lower and depreciation will be lower. This shows us that the previous definition of depreciation is not correct if the resource is not extracted optimally. This result should not be surprising. Since depreciation is the decline in the value of the resource and the resource is not valued correctly by the market, depreciation is also not going to be calculated correctly. Under sub-optimal exploitation, Hotelling rule is no longer guaranteed and we could have any rule being used to form expectations over the evolution of the resource price. In this case, we could have idiosyncratic rules being used by individuals to form expectations with particular perceptions on the depreciation rate. Consequently, the decentralized allocation would differ from the planner's solution and the question of how to incorporate this into a coordinated formal model is still an open issue. Summing up, the question for the application of current accounting techniques is whether depreciation may still be valued under these sub-optimal conditions based on Hotelling rent measures or this relationship will break down?.
THE BRAZILIAN CASE STUDY.
The Estimation Sets.
The model adopted, as said before, calculates the depreciation under the optimal use of an exhaustible resource, employing the Hotelling rule relationship and arriving into some estimations of depreciation approximated by the Hotelling rent, as proposed by Vincent (1997).30 The main objective of this case study is to estimate depreciation values of forests in the Amazonian Region, a typical frontier area where user cost perception fades. It is assumed that timber is a non-renewable resource based on the fact, already discussed in Section 1, that forestland conversion in this frontier area is mostly devoted to agricultural production and cattle raising and the possibilities for second growth forest are almost nil. Consequently, our depreciation values will not consider any charges for forest regrowth. As it was seen in the previous section, there are basically three shortcuts to calculate the depreciation of natural capital: the net price (NPM), user cost (ESM) and H&V approaches. The latter, is a generalization of the other two in the sense that, assigning different values to the parameter , would provide us with the other two specific formulas. As discussed before, the theoretical advantage of the H&V approach is that it enable us to use data on the average cost, multiplying it by a conversion factor without getting an upward bias on the depreciation. This would yield, under optimal use of the resource, an accurate estimation of the scarcity rent since it is the Hotelling rent, and not the total rent, that is equivalent to the depreciation under optimal conditions. The timber industry in the Amazon can be classified in two main activities: timber harvesting and wood processing. Generally the timber is harvested and transported to the sawmill where it is sold with the cut and the transport activities being performed by the same economic agent. In some regions, there is a third economic agent in the process, the "bufeteiro". He is a truck driver who gets the wood in the forest, transports it to the saw mills and sells it. More recently, this industrial structure has changed. There has been a trend of vertical integration taking place in the region with the increase participation of sawmills in the extraction process.31 Theoretically, the calculation of scarcity rents depends critically on the prevailing property right's regime in the region. If there exist an open access situation, over extraction of timber is very likely to occur, causing the dissipation of rents. Despite the fact that property rights are not secure in the Amazon, there is some belief that it is not the case of the existence of an open access regime of exploitation. Consequently, the timber extraction would yield positive rents from the extractive activity. The formula used to calculate scarcity rents is the generalized formula from H&V: D(t ) = -[ pq (t ) - C (q (t ))](1 +  ) / [1 +  (1 + i ) S ( t ) / q ( t ) -1 ] . It can be observed in the formula that the exhaustion period, S ( t ) / q ( t ) - 1 , enters the calculation in an exponential way. This would make it the leading parameter in the final result. Any large exhaustion period would result into very low scarcity rent.
We have pointed previously the limitations of this analysis for a sub-optimal situation. Nevertheless there is no alternative method developed for the measurement of depreciation in such cases. 31 In Paragominas (Pará) in 1990, 63% of sawmills had some involvement with extraction. By 1995, 84% of small firms and 79% of large firms participated in timber extraction. On the other hand, in Tailândia (Pará), 23% of sawmills were involved with extraction in 1990, while by 1995 that number increased to 75%. See Stone (forthcoming) for more details on the process of vertical integration of sawmills in the Brazilian Amazon.
Previous studies32 have already identified very large exhaustion periods for forestland conversion in the region. Being the largest tropical forest in the world, it is not surprising that, even at the actual extraction rates, it would still take some time to completely excerpt all kinds of timber available in the forest. This is basically the main problem when we perform these kind of calculations for the timber production in the Amazonian region as a whole. It seems as we could still harvest it for many years before scarcity is perceived. Because of this "bias" caused by the still enormous size of the Amazon,33 we have also calculated the scarcity rent for a specific species of wood under threat of extinction and tried to observe how scarcity rent estimates alter in cases of lower available stock. The selected wood species was mahogany. Being the royal wood exploited in the region for many years, counting for almost 50% of the Brazilian timber export value, its stock has been decreasing rapidly during the past decade. Recently, its log and exports were temporally banned by the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment in 1996. As will be seen, mahogany prices are by far higher than any other timber variety.34 In this study, the all timber variable is a composite good for which the data on cost and output is not differentiated among species35. Consequently we treat timber as a single stock with an unique exhaustion time. Mahogany estimates, on the other hand, are specific for this specie and reflects its greater scarcity. Although mahogany is part of the all timber composite good, its user cost is dissipated when we aggregate it with the all timber. Consequently, results on Table 4 show an aditivity bias. As it will be observed, for all values of the elasticity of the marginal extraction cost greater than zero, the depreciation value for all timber is lower than mahogany depreciation. This occurs because as the elasticity of the marginal extraction cost increases, the exhaustion period becomes the driving factor in the depreciation result. When mahogany is included in the all timber variable, the average exhaustion period increases and its greater relative scarcity fades away.36 Implicitly, we are assuming for the all timber measurements that loggers see timber stock as a whole and do not differentiate species in their decisions on exploitation levels. If exploitation of species are treated separately, each specie's user costs, as those estimated for mahogany, should be separately measured and then added up. Apart from depreciation calculation for all timber and mahogany separately, we also apply the three depreciation valuation approaches presented above. Based on the generality of the H&V formula, values of the elasticity of the marginal cost curve are set to zero for the NPM, infinity for the ESM and intermediate values for the H&V approaches. Finally we undertake a sensitivity analysis with discount rates of 2%, 4% and 10% to enable us to analyse the differences in the scarcity rents due to differences in time preference.37 All estimation cases.
See, for example, Funatura/Itto (1993), Prado (1995) and Seroa da Motta (1997). This is a really important matter. If the Brazilian Amazon was smaller we would get a higher value for the depreciation. 34 With that ban the Brazilian government understood that the inclusion of mogno at the Annex 2 of the CITES was not necessary as proposed in the last general conference in 1997. 35 Ideally we would have data on cost, price, stock and output for each specie of timber in the Amazon. W e would then calculate the depreciation charge for each specie separately. Due to the lack of data availability, this analysis is not possible. 36 We thank Michael Linddal for pointing this out. 37 This is specially important if comparisons on depreciation values are going to be made among developed and developing countries. Dixon, Hamilton and Kunte (1997) suggest values in the 2%-4% range for developed countries. However, according to Seroa da Motta (1988) capital opportunity cost in Brazil has been historically around 10%.
21 are carried out only for the years 1990 and 1995 due to data availability, although it covers an important and recent period of forest conversion in the region. It is important to note that we are not estimating depreciation values for a single state or region, we are looking at the Brazilian Amazon as a whole. We are interested in the national macroeconomic perspective since the depreciation calculated would be deducted from the national GDP to incorporate a sustainability perspective in national accounts. Consequently, we are taking into account the fact that economic agents perceive stock of wood across political frontiers as equally accessible.38 Naturally, if we had studied a highly cleared area, we would have obtained high depreciation values, but this verification would not yield any perspective on the Brazilian sustainability issue, unless the region had the majority of the timber extraction and could be regarded as a closed economy. 5.2 Database.
The study area will be the so-called Legal Amazon, only excluding the State of Mato Grosso due to the lack of data on timber stocks.39 As mentioned in Section 1, timber extraction in Brazil takes place mainly in the Amazon from primary forests, accounting today for more than 75% of the Brazilian production of logs. The State of Pará alone produces almost 80% of the timber output in the region. However, data on the timber sector in the region is very scattered, particularly economic information on the production side. Due to its enormous size, ecological complexity and economic dispersion, it is extremely difficult to perform any systematic survey of the sector. When data is available, it does not usually follow the same pattern and, consequently, aggregation becomes a very complex task. Two kind of data were used in this study: official aggregated data from the National Statistical Office (IBGE) and specific and punctual studies undertaken for academic and research purposes with a more limited coverage. There is a trade-off in using each one of these sources. The official aggregated figures, although reliable, do not go in details for species and locations and are based on declarations which certainly avoid not legal output. On the other hand, specific studies present good data and particular information, but the generalization of this information for the Amazon as a whole has to be done carefully. As it was presented in the previous sub-section, the data required for the estimation sets, following the generalized formulae, are log prices, output, average cost, stock and the elasticity of the marginal cost curve. The extraction of timber and the production of sawnwood in the Amazon is very diversified. Not only it takes place in many of the states, but it is also carried out by many economic agents. A great variety of trees are harvested in a very heterogeneous way and, consequently, it is very hard to monitor the extraction of logs and its processing. As a result, a general database containing prices of wood, quantity extracted, extraction costs and stock of timber in the Amazon is not available.
In many cases the timber extracted in some state is converted into processed wood in some other state. For the sawmill there is no additional transaction cost, for a given distance, to bring timber from another state for processing purposes. 39 That covers states of Amazonas, Pará, Rondônia, Amapá, Roraima, Acre, Tocantins and Maranhão. Mato Grosso State, here not considered, is not relevant in terms of rain forest against the other states.
22 It was possible to define two procedures to identify price series. One was the use of data from the IBGE on quantity extracted and value of production, dividing the former by the latter to obtain an implicit price for wood. This data was available on a time series and it would enable us to observe the evolution of the implicit price of wood through time. However, the estimated implicit prices appeared to be very erratic and with no relationship to export prices and other sources. The shortcoming of this source seems to be related to the lack of reliability on the figures on production value. Moreover, data is aggregated with no identification of species. Another procedure used was based on two regional studies. The first one was Stone (1998) which utilises data from field surveys in the Paragominas region (State of Pará) elaborated by the Imazon (Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amazônia) in 1990 and 1995. The survey included 33 wood processing firms in 1990 and 40 firms in 1995. Given the predominance of the Pará wood industry in the region, these values can be considered to be fairly representative for the Amazon as a whole. Stone (1998) presents an average price of logs and sawnwood and classifies them in five groups based on the value of the wood, from high to very low valuable wood. The second regional data source was a study on wood extraction in the State of Rondônia conducted by the consultancy firm Tecnosolo-DHV (1997) which presents a very detailed wood price list. Although it is a very rich database, generalization with prices from Rondônia is less reliable due to the small representativeness of its timber industry in comparison with Pará. Nonetheless, cross checking with Stone (1998) data showed consistency if one takes into account the division of wood types. Estimates of costs of extraction and processing of wood in the Amazon are very rare. Once more, we have relied on Stone (1998) which presents average extraction costs and transportation costs for 1990 and 1995 for both small and large firms. For the logging activity, the difference between small and large loggers is based on the number of chain saws, trucks, bulldozers and log-lifters used in the extraction process. For the sawmills, the size is determined in the sample, by the number of band-saws. Small mills operate with one band-saw while large mills operate with two or more. The data on the cost structure of logging for 1990 is based only on small firms. This is the only data presented in Stone (1998). This would not cause a huge bias since the majority of firms operating in 1990 were small (approximately 80%). However for 1995, we had data available for small and large firms. To calculate the unit cost, we created a composite cost as the average of costs from small and large firms, weighted by their relative contributions to the total production volume. Man-made capital costs of extraction and transportation average costs were also calculated with the three discount rate scenarios40 using the same rates applied for the depreciation formula. Data on timber output was taken from the IBGE figures, although there was some concern about their poor spatial coverage, they were the only available source for the region as a whole. Data on the total aggregated stock of timber in the Amazon was estimated by Prado (1995) for the year 1990, based mostly on IBGE data, in fairly detailed spatial coverage but without.
Stone (1998) adopted a 20% rate since that was the bank rate prevailing in 1995 in Brazil after the Real stabilization plan.
23 distinction for wood species. The only caveat was the absence of data for the State of Mato Grosso. In our estimates of the stock figures, we have deducted from the physical stock all the timber stock available in conservation areas. To estimate the 1995 stock we have used data on the quantity extracted of timber from IBGE assuming that the stock evolution was proportional to the rate of change in the log extraction. This is a strong assumption since there is illegal logging that would not be taken into account in the IBGE and output lost in the harvesting process.41 Both cases allow for an overestimation on the timber stock. Mahogany stock and output time series were not available. However, Barros et alii (1992) has made some estimates for 1990. Consequently our calculations were restricted to 1990 in the case of mahogany. Table 3 presents the selected data indicators for timber stock (S), output (q), price (p), average cost (AC) and net price (NP) for the years 1990 and 1995.

The determination of the elasticity of the marginal cost curve () was not available in the literature for the Brazilian case, although it is widely recognized that in frontier areas it is highly dependent on transport costs. Efforts to obtain transport cost data to undertake an econometric exercise to measure  did not succeed as well. Therefore, we have assumed two arbitrary values for  -- 1 and 3 -- to apply the V&H approach following ranges assumed in the relevant literature for other cases.42 5.3 Results.
Although Verissimo et alii (1992) estimated that for every cubic meter of wood that is logged, in the region of Paragominas in Pará state, there are two cubic meters that are lost, one cannot generalizes that for the whole region. Illegal logging figures is still more controversial since, as discussed earlier, clearing licenses legalizes logging output. 42 Vincent (1990), for example, uses values varying from 1.5 to 4.5 while Vincent (1997) adopts value of 3 for Malaysia. In principle, other region's elasticity values may not keep any relevance for the Amazonian region. As we will observe later, higher elasticity values leads to results similar to those here employed.

Note that scarcity in the case of all timber stock in the Amazon is not a real threat considering such a large exhaustion time, as our depreciation estimates will show. Nonetheless, the mahogany case, when considered alone, will be otherwise more prone to reflect depletion costs due to the possibility of taking into account its much lower exhaustion period. As it can be observed in Table 4, as  increases the user cost becomes larger for mahogany relative to all timber. As already discussed in Section 5.1, this is a consequence of the aditivity bias caused by the fact that mahogany specific user cost is not added up separately, but instead, aggregated into the all timber before estimating the depreciation value. Increases in the discount rate decrease the depreciation values, as shown in Table.
This result differ from other studies on the fact that changes in the discount rate for the net price method change the depreciation values. This could sound surprising since when =0 the discount rate should not play a role on the depreciation calculations. Nevertheless, since we included charges for man-made capital costs (capital opportunity cost of machinery and equipments) on the calculation of total cost, discount rate will affect these charges and, consequently, net price estimates.
25 Therefore changes occurring to the depreciation based on the net price method is due to the differences on average costs when discounting rates varies affecting man-made capital charges and not due the adopted V&H depreciation formula which does not have any discounting on it for net price measures.43 At 10% discount rate, all timber user cost and H&V values decrease significantly tending to an almost negligible value. Mahogany values are significant at all rates insofar mahogany exploitation presents lower exhaustion periods and larger net profits. It should be noted that, even considering the underestimation of logging production figures due to illegal practices, say, exhaustion time for the total stock of timber would be still high enough to generate negligible depreciation values. Our results are also consistent with the theory. As the discount rate increases, the present value of future flow of rents decrease, causing a substantial decrease in the depreciation measure. This result confirms the fact that depreciation values are very sensitive to the discount factor used in its calculation.44 Observing again Table 4, for given discount rates, depreciation values decrease as the elasticity of the marginal extraction cost increases. We can easily identify these differences in our estimates. The user cost estimate ( =) is eminently lower than the estimate of the net price ( =0). This result goes in the direction expected based on other estimates of depreciation in the natural resource accounting literature.45 The results for 1995 in Table 5 show that depreciation magnitudes are higher than the similar ones for 1990 in all cases, although still with low significance at 10% discounting. That upward variation is conformed with the adopted methodology due again to the increase in net profit magnitude and the reduction of exhaustion time. Also comparing the 1995 results across discount rate yields the same results observed for 1990, that is, increases in the discount parameter, and diminishes substantially the depreciation estimates. In this sense, the distinction between the methods is very important as noted by Atkinson et alii (1997), "The distinction between net-price and user-cost is not just of theoretical interest: for countries with very long-lived deposits, even small discount rates will yield user costs that are much smaller than current rents.".
Remember that if =0 the formula used is pq-c(q), although it can also be argued that net price method is the special case of zero rate of discount. 44 This fact was already exposed in graphical terms by El Serafy (1989). 45 That was also observed in estimations for natural capital depreciation in Brazil for 1980/90, see Seroa da Motta (1995).
FINAL COMMENTS.
This study was primarily concerned with the estimation of forest depreciation in the Brazilian Amazon, measured as the timber scarcity rent. Considering the still large timber stock available in the region, depreciation values were not meaningful. Moreover, taking into account the quasi-open access features of timber exploitation in the region, an important question arises related to the existence and capture of this scarcity rent in the Amazonian context. Timber industry in the Amazon has also a complex productive structure. Monopsonic sawmill power can be easily enforced when extraction are undertaken in a complete open access region. Recent studies using local surveys, as those mentioned in our database section, have however, pointed out a trend towards vertical integration in the timber industry. This trend is probably a consequence of higher profitability on the logging activity with the enlargement of the frontier vis-à-vis the requirement of heavy investments on milling and more costly transportation. Stone (1998) brings about net profit data on the timber extractive and processing activities in the Amazon for 1990 and 1995 and it can be observed that in this period, profit margin of the extractive (including transportation to processing facilities) activities has not only dropped from 11 to 8%, but it has come down to losses of about -3% in the processing activity.46 This results would suggest that, if scarcity rents are captured by prices, they are captured in the extraction process. As said before, apart from the still large stock of timber, the quasi-open access features of timber exploitation in the Amazonian region may also lead to poor scarcity rent perception by economic agents in the timber industry structure. Our results on depreciation measures have been consistently low, although their magnitudes were dependent on the assumed discount rates and marginal cost elasticities for which we were not able to estimate objective values. Moreover, other economic factors, as well as institutional and legal aspects, may be affecting logging activities in the region during the analysed period and a distinct trend may take place if these constraints are relaxed in the near future. However, if full scarcity rents are really part of supply pricing is still an open issue considering the quasi-open access features of the Amazonian region. Our results can, however, make a modest contribution to this debate. Estimated depreciation values for the timber extraction activity in the Amazon as a whole were very low in the ESM and V&H approaches due mainly to very high exhaustion periods. Even considering overestimation biases of our stock figures, say, by 100%, exhaustion time would be significant, over 100 years, and still leading to low depreciation values due to discounting procedures. Their relative magnitude when charged against the timber activity value added47 were close to zero, apart from values at the very low discounting rate of 2%, as shown in Table.
Even though, user cost and H&V relative values were very low varying from 0.24% to 0.69% of the value added. As it can be observed, the percentage of depreciation as a proportion of the timber value added are only meaningful for the net price approach estimates which.
Even if lower capital costs were taken in Stone's estimations, large firms would still face a decline profitability. 47 Value added figures for timber extraction were not available for the region from national accounts, therefore, we constructed these figures using the survey data used for the depreciation estimates. It should be noted that we are measuring value added as a GDP measure, that is, gross of capital costs.
28 accounted for 41.17 % in 1995 and 39.72% in 1990. However, it was already argued that such approach could only grasp scarcity rents in very special cases.

Depreciation Measures as Proportion of Timber Value Added (%).
It could be claimed, considering the forestland conversion process in the region discussed in Section 2, that these depreciation values should be instead compared to the regional value added from cropping and cattle raising activities. If we perform such comparisons, these relative values would be even lower since agriculture value added is almost four times bigger than timber extraction's. On the other hand, mahogany depreciation measures compared to timber value added have revealed higher percentages, as shown in Table 7, even at 10% discount rate. These results are mainly a consequence of the substantially lower exhaustion time of mahogany in the Amazon.

1990 i = 0.02  All Timber Proportion Mahogany Proportion i = 0.04  All Timber Proportion Mahogany Proportion i = 0.10  All Timber Proportion Mahogany Proportion.
1.59 26.21  0.71 11.71  0.07 1.14.
Charges of mahogany depreciation against its own value added may reach up to 36% with i = 2% and ===1. Although this charging procedure may not be appropriate when mahogany can be substituted for other species, these figures gives again a clear picture of the sensitivity of the results to the exhaustion time of the resource. As the forest is used up, considering the transversality condition, the ratio between the Hotelling rent and the total rent tends to one, achieving this value when the resource is exhausted completely. This ratio, using our 1990 all timber V&H depreciation values (with  = 1) to total rent ( = 0) at a 2% rate, is very small around 0.012. At higher discounting rates,.
29 this ratio decreases dramatically to negligible values, confirming the absence of timber scarcity rent in the Amazonian context. However, for mahogany, this ratio is approximately 0.62 at 2% discounting and only reduced to 0.34 at 4% rate. These ratio magnitudes suggest that mahogany exploitation is being exhausted in a mining process and scarcity being captured at market transactions. It also emphasises once more the importance of exhaustion time over the discounting rate in the estimation of scarcity rent. However, taking into account all timber depreciation measures, these results indicate that depreciation charges against the forestry sector as a whole in the Amazon lacks sound economic meaning and will not bring about the sustainability issue of the forest. Charges related to other forest services are, therefore, a paramount to make environmental accounting an useful tool for planning in the Amazonian context.48 Consequently, the debate on the controversy of methodological approaches covered in the literature, and put forward in the previous sections of this study, may lose importance when one is planning in regions where high exhaustion time and lack of property rights are the cases. Although they are not the aim and scope of this study, we also bring about some policy concerns at the light of our results. If scarcity rents are not fully perceived, or they really do not exist in such huge supply conditions as our estimates may suggest, an increase in timber exports may accelerate the deforestation process without the promising trade welfare gains.49 Apart from, usually ineffective measures of trade barriers, in term of environmental policy, such perspective leads to actions aimed at the changing of the property right system and enforcement controls. Scarcity has to be introduced into economic agent's behaviour by market mechanisms. Therefore, the current initiatives of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment to create large areas of National Forests for concession schemes, for timber exploitation at sustainable basis, are important steps into promoting the exploitation of the Amazon50 taking into account user costs. These are issues for which applied economics research may prove to pay high dividends.
Seroa da Motta and May (1995) had already brought about this issue since user cost measures were also very small for their estimates. 49 See Chichilnisky (1994) and Ferraz (1997) for a discussion of this issue. 50 See Seroa da Motta (1997) for the rationale of this initiative and its institutional and legal problems.
User Cost Dissipation Under Open Access.
We can illustrate the situation of absence of scarcity capture using a simple example adapted from Baland and Platteau (1996). Suppose we have a forest that is an open access, and assume the entire stock of timber is given by S. Let us consider an input called manwith-a-saw, n. The total amount extracted of timber Y depends on the amount of n employed represented by the function F(n). Using as an example a quadratic production function, Y = an - bn 2 , and normalising the price of timber to one, we can characterise the equilibrium situation. Under open access, the average product Y/n, is equal to w, the price of the input.51Therefore the open access situation is characterised by:.
The rent from this activity is F (n) - wn . Using the previous result in the rent equation, we can observe that under open access the rent is completely dissipated,.
F ( n o ) - wn o = 0 .
If the extraction activity was privately owned, the necessary condition for profit maximization would be the equality between the price of the input, w, and the marginal product (not the average product as in the open access situation). This equilibrium condition will lead to:.
Substituting this condition in the rent equation, it can be noted that we will have a positive rent:.
F (n * ) - wn * = (a - w) 2 / 4b .
For a detailed discussion on this result see Weitzman (1974).

METHODOLOGY.
Pine Volumetric Growth.
To determine the volumetric growth of pinus radiata have been used two methods: a) Logistic Function of the Pine Volumetric Growth.
We have determined a Logistic Function of the Pine Volumetric growth in according to the record given by the INFOR. In this relationship are considered: volume and age. The function is the following: with an adjusted R - squared of 0.9969. f(t) = 4.970525t + 2.188126t2 - 0.044910t3.
Logistic Shape Radiata Pine.
Relationship beteween standing volume per hectare (net of defect) and age.
Function linear : 25 m3/ha/year.
This yield corresponds to the Annual Medium Increase used by the INFOR to determine the volume by hectare and by age. 2.2 Eucalyptus Volumetric Growth.
It has been used the Annual Medium Increase applied by the INFOR and corresponds to 22 m3/ha/year. It has not been possible to estimate a function growth logistics by lack of information.
4 2.3 Rotation Period.
To determine the rotation period the following criteria have been used. a) Technically Optimal Rotation Period.
The equilibrium condition is: f'(t) = f(t)/t Result: 24 years old b) Economical Solution of Faustmann-Pressler -Ohlin (Infinite Plantation Cycles).
Max VAN = Pf (t )e - rt - K - R e - rt dt.
dVAN = Pf ' (t ) - rPf (t ) - R = 0 dt V= R r.
The equilibrium condition is:.
Pf ' (t ) = r [Pf (t ) + V ].
V = 800 US$/ha (estimated figure by the INFOR for forest land exclusively) Legend r : interest rate K: regeneration cost R: land rent Result: 18 years old c) Rotation Age of Major Frequency Registered in Chile for Pinus Radiata.
According to the record given by the INFOR the rotation age of major frequency registered in Chile is of 20 years. This period was used to determine the appreciation not only in the logistic function of the pine volumetric growth, but also in the linear function. d) Rotation Age of Major Frequency Registered in Chile for Eucalyptus.
According to the record given by the INFOR the rotation age of major frequency registered in Chile for the eucalyptus is of 12 years. This period was used to determine the appreciation as a linear growth function (264 m3/ha). 2.4 Calculus of the Appreciation of the Forestry Asset.
The calculus formuli to determine the appreciation of the forestry asset have been suggested by Michael Linddal.1.
5 The appendix shows assess the asset value and appreciation of a perpetual forest rotation with regeneration costs (Co), rotation age (T), interest rate (r), volume harvested (q(T)), and flat rate current resource rents of timber price (p) less extraction costs (c). Continuous discounting is assumed: (1+r)-rt  e-rt. Every rotation has prior to the establishment (planting) a net present value of R (equation 1). For perpetual forest rotation the net present value is an annuity of a payment R every T year. This is equal to the land value for forest S(T) (equation 2). After planting the establishment costs are sunk cost. The asset value of a forest of age t is equal to the value of the harvest in (T-t) years and the value of forest land thereafter. The asset value is known as the soil expectation value SEV(t) (equation 3). The appreciation from year t to year t+1 (D(t)) is the difference in the asset value (equation 4). Equation 1: Value of one rotation Equation 2: Value of forest land Equation 3: Soil expectation value Equation 4: Appreciation R = H(T) * e-rT ­ Co S(T) = R / (1- e-rT) SEV(t) = [ S(T) + H(T) ] * e-r (T-t) D(t) = SEV(t+1) ­ SEV(t) = SEV(t+1/2)*r.
For land coming into forest either as replanted or afforestation the asset value in t=0 is SEV(0)=[S(T) + H(T)] * e-rT because the regeneration costs are sunk. The asset value for t=T is SEV(T) = S(T) + H(T) just before harvest (sum of stumpage and land value) and S(T) just after harvest (land value only) but before replanting. For forest stands not harvested in year T or with a stand age above T it is assumed that the asset value is H(T) + S(T), i.e. there is neither an appreciation due to growth or a depreciation due to over maturity of the timber. Legend: R = net present value of one forest rotation t = stand age T = rotation age r = interest rate Co = regeneration cost H(T) = harvest value at rotation age S(T) = land value for forest at rotation age T SEV(T) = soil expectation value (asset value) D(t) = appreciation of asset value from t to t+1.

Other Premises and Assumptions In order to carry out the calculations the following premises and assumptions were taken in consideration: a) b) c) The costs of exploitation of an hectare of Pinus radiata stays constant during all the period of analysis. It was estimated for 24, 20 and 18 years.(See Table 5) The price on site of a cubic meter of Pinus radiata wood equal to 25 US$/ m3.. It was valued constant for all of the period of analysis. (See Table 4) The real utilized annual interest rate (r) is 7.97%, which is close to the interest rates that the managers of the forestry industry use when they borrow money for the long term. For its calculation, it was deflected 6.6%, the appraisal of inflation corresponding to the year 1996. The nominal annual interest rate of 8.5% for the long term credits. The real interest rate stays constant during all the period of analysis. All the calculations have been carried out in dollars of 1996. The average type of change corresponding to that year was of 1US$= $Ch 396.773. Source: Central Bank of Chile. Monthly Bulletin N° 8733, July 1997.
13 e) The information registered by INFOR on the Inventory of Plantations of Pinus radiata is complete- by age range- for the years 1985 to 1996. However, it was necessary estimate the information for the day of plantations of the year 1985, 1986 and 1987, which according to the statistics, should be included in the range of age 1 ­ 5 years. That is why, to determine the right numbers for each age, every range was divided by.
In all cases, the figures are nets of forest fires and plagues. The coefficient's estimate of the losses for plagues, illness and blazes for the Pinus radiata, already applied by INFOR in their statistics, are contained in the Introduction of the Environmental Accounting in the National Bills of the Central Bank of Chile Project. Investigation financed by the Central Bank of Chile and executed by the Forest Institute in collaboration with the Department of Agrarian Economy of the Catholic University of Chile. 1996. To verify the consistency of the figures given by INFOR, a follow-up of the plantations between 1955 and 1996 was done to determine the planted surface by age without taking into account the losses by fire, plagues and harvest. These figures compared to the registered by INFOR are consistent in spite of the fact that they present with a range of 5 years. The principal destinations of the Pinus radiata harvest are saw logs (80%) and pulp wood (20%). The registrations of current demand shows a preferential behaviour for pulp wood products over saw wood products. It is estimated that 96% of the net production coming of the Eucalyptus sp. forests, including thinning, is oriented towards pulp or derived products. Utilized Information. Explanatory Notes.
Following is the detailed information that was utilized in order to calculate the Appreciation of the Forest Resource Pinus radiata. 3.3.1 Planted surface of pinus radiata for age.
The planted surface of Pinus radiata for age for the period 1985 ­ 1996 has been obtained from the official figures published by the Chilean Forest Institute (INFOR). These figures are nets of harvests and losses from forest fires and plagues. The utilized information presents the forest hectares assembled in categories of age, with ranges of 5 years. To estimate the corresponding hectares for each age class, a simple average for range of age was calculated. The basic information is presented in Table.
The harvested hectares in each year were added, before the nets of harvest and of plagues and fires, to determine the hectares of standing crop. A special calculation for the age 0 has been carried out for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987. The plantations of age 0, according to the official figures of INFOR, are included in the range of ages 1-5 years. To get them, the standard of survival which is equivalent to an average of 75%, was applied to the net plantation figures; getting this way the net plantations for the year 0, which are at the same time, subtracted of the range of ages 1-5 years.

The official figures of INFOR, for these 3 years, corresponding to the range of ages 1-5, include the plantations of age.
It has been necessary to separate the figures for each range of age, taking on that only 75% of the plantations of the year 0 survived. Figure 3 Planted Surface of Pinus Radiata (Hectares).

In the projection, a volumetric growth equal to 25 m3/ha/year is supposed, and corresponds to the pondered average calculated for the country. In Chile, Pinus radiata grows in an extension of more than 1,000 kilometers of surface.
15 In order to determine the rhythm of the volumetric growth of Pinus radiata, in annual m3 per hectare, the following variables are considered : Zones of mayor concentration of plantations, site index2 and site class. 3.3.2 Prices.
In order to calculate the Actual Value of the Pinus radiata forest resource, the on the site costs of wood was utilized. This, to their time, was determined from the costs of wood put in factory, to who the expenses for concept of discharge and patio, transport from the forest until the plant and hauling were discounted.

The evolution of the real prices for Pinus radiata logs for the period 1986 ­ 1996 are shown in Table 15. 3.3.3 Cost Of On Site Production Of 1 M3 Of Pinus Radiata.
In order to calculate the cost of on site production of an hectare of Pinus radiata, the following items were considered : Establishment of the Plantation, Fire prevention maintenance, Administration, Protection and Road Construction. In order to determine the average cost of on site production of 1 m3 of wood, the following assumptions were taken in consideration: · · · o calculate the volumetric growth have been used a Logistics Function. The final objective of forestation is to produce saw logs (80%) and pulp wood (20%). Two commercial thinnings and 3 prunes are realized in the 20 year period.

Cost of Establishment. The cost of establishment varies according to the initial considerate density and includes the following tasks: Underbrush clearance, burning, fencing, soil preparation, fire prevention, plantation, control of overgrowths and/ or rodents and fertilization. The initial value of the establishment of the plantation in the year zero, according to INFOR, is of 530 US$/ ha. Cost of Harvest. It includes: Cutting, logging and encampment installation. Fire Control Maintenance. The annual cost is of 19 US$/ ha/ year. The Future Value of this annuality was calculated, for: 24, 20 and 18 years and to an annual interest rate of the 7.97%. Administration and Protection Includes: Surveillance, supervision, minor maintenance, insurance against fire and disasters, plague control labors, and fire fighting. The cost of Administration and Protection are, according to INFOR, of 7.4 US$/ha/year. The Future Value of this annuality was calculated for : 24, 20 and 18 years to an interest rate of the 7.97%.

In order to carry out the calculations the following premises and assumptions were taken in consideration : a) b) c) The costs of exploitation of an hectare of Eucalyptus sp stays constant during all the period of analysis. It was estimated to be 16.23 US$ / m3. (See Table 9) The price on site of a cubic meter of Eucalyptus sp. wood equal to 39 US$/ m3 was valued constant for all of the period of analysis. (See Table 8) The real utilized annual interest rate (r) is 7.97%. And it belongs to a nominal annual interest rate of 8.5% for the long term credits. To deflect, a 6.6% appraisal of inflation corresponding to the year 1996 was applied. The real interest rate stays constant during all the period of analysis. All the calculations have been carried out in dollars of 1996. The average type of change corresponding to that year was of 1US$= $Ch 396.773. Source: Central Bank of Chile. Monthly Bulletin N° 8733, July 1997. The produced volume at the end of the 12 years has been valued in 264m3 / ha. In this calculation all the trees of same age (which are the majority) or superior to 12 years (mature trees that have not been harvested in the previous years) are considered. For the last ones, the output stays on 264 m3/ha. These calculations are produced from the Annual Medium Increment, that in case of the Eucalyptus sp. is 22 m3/ ha/ year.

20 f) The information registered by INFOR on the Inventory of Plantations of Eucalyptus sp. is complete- by age range- only for the years 1995 and 1996. However, for the years 1985 to 1994 only exists global information. Consequently, in order to carry out the required calculations presently reported, this global information by ages has been distributed, applying an average percentage distribution (% T) produced during the years 1995 and 1996. The principal destination of the Eucalyptus sp. harvest is pulp. The registrations of current demand shows a preferential behaviour for pulp wood products over saw wood products. It is estimated that 96% of the net production coming of the Eucalyptus sp. forests, including thinnings, are oriented towards pulp or derived products. In all cases, the figures are nets of forest fires and plagues. The coefficient's estimate of the losses for plagues, illness and blazes for the Eucalyptus sp., already applied by INFOR in their statistics, are contained in the Introduction of the Environmental Accounting in the National Bills of the Central Bank of Chile Project.

A Brief on the Forestry Outlook Study1 Emmanuel K. Alieu Director of Forests Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry & Marine Resources Youyi Building, Brookfields, Freetown, Sierra Leone Tel: 232-22 34 45; Fax :232- 24 21 28/24 16 13 MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL FORCES Forest Management There is inadequate staff and funding of the Forestry Division. Inefficient supervision of local pole supply contracts are affecting the protection of forests in the Western Area Peninsula forests. The Village Forestry Associations (supported by the Forestry Act, 1998) and the National Association of Farmers of Sierra Leone require support to facilitate community participation in forest management. There are important bird sanctuaries that are being protected and managed with GEF and other donor funding. Forest Policy and Implementation There has been a collapse of sector institutions due to the civil conflict. · Lack of Inter-sector Cooperation: There is lack of coordination among the stakeholder ministries. · Inefficient Forest Revenue Systems: A review of the revenue system to reflect market realities is required to increase benefits to forest-dependent communities so as to solicit their cooperation and also to facilitate adequate financing of forest management. · Lack of Investment in the Forestry Sector: there is virtually no public or private investments in forest management. Forest Industry Under the trade liberalisation policy, the export of logs has been banned to promote local processing and employment generation. The export of lumber (except packaging wood) was also banned in 1990. Packaging wood is also a construction material for the poor in the country. Fiscal incentives have been given for the importation of sawmilling equipment. The importation of chainsaw as well as the trade in chainsaw lumber is unregulated. Plywood, particleboard, hardboard and match splint are imported. Returnees also import furniture. The logging and sawmilling industries have been affected by political interference and lack of transparency. Most of the machinery is also obsolete. There is lack of local skills in the wood industry sector. MACRO-ENVIRONMENTAL FORCES Energy The majority of the population (95%) uses kerosene. Its price has been kept relatively constant by subsidy even though the petroleum price increase during the past decade averages 27%. Further increases in the high prices as well as the prices of kerosene and modern stoves will cause many people to switch to firewood.
FOSA website available at: http://www.fao.org/forestry/FON/FONS/outlook/Africa/AFRhom-e.stm.
The consumption of firewood and charcoal is about 6.2 million m3 and 396,000 m3 roundwood equivalent. The 5MW Goma Hydro Electric dam relies on petroleum fuel during the dry season due to low water levels. There is a potential hydropower (i.e. the 305MW Bumbuna Hydro Electric Project) that is expected to be completed by the year 2004. The Bumbuna dam is expected to produce surplus energy for export to neighbouring countries. Other 24 potential hydro-electric sites appear to be under threat from shifting cultivation. Deforestation Infrastructure development: There is the need for proper planning of infrastructure developments (e.g. roads, mining etc.) so as to minimise their effects on the forest resources. Agriculture: The high prices of inorganic fertiliser encourages the cultivation of larger acreage. The Institute of Agricultural Research and the Rice Research Station have sedentary farming packages for peasant farmers that are yet to be demonstrated in the field. This can have the effect of reducing pressure on the forests and the "uplands". Economic factors The economic performance has been poor. A trade deficit balance of about US$34 billion was reported in the 1993/94 period. There is substantial illegal cross border trade in timber products (especially timber and charcoal) within the Mano River Union (MRU). This has been facilitated by the civil strife in the region that has created insecurity on the land and water routes linking the countries in the MRU. The high price differential between lumber from Sierra Leone and the neighbouring countries is also a contributing factor. Per capita income has been decreasing over the past two decades. Demographic factors Population growth rate is about 2.5%. About 80% of the population is rural based. There has been about a decade of civil conflict with a resultant destabilisation of about 60% of the population, increased rural-urban migration, and migration outside the country. Among the issues to be addressed as a result of the civil conflict is the rehabilitation of returnees with its attendant requirements for building materials (the construction of about 300,000 housing units nationwide has been planned) and the provision of household energy that will have effect on the extent of forest extraction. There is a mass exodus of labour to the minefields. This has effected the labour availability for agriculture and forestry. SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT The questionnaire technique was used to solicit opinions about the likely future impacts of the key driving forces on the forest resource base. Expectations or wishes for some identified driving forces as well as for some related potential projects for the year 2020 have been presented separately. Most of these portray negative trends. But the possibilities of the trends taking place, how they will take place and why are not explained well. In some cases, the actual effects of the forces have been predicted for the future. The current states of the other driving forces and their future potential have also been described. Proposals are made with respect to policy and institutional changes that are essential to the challenges facing the forestry sector to year 2020. These include capacity building, community forestry development, restructuring/rehabilitation of the forest industry, improvements in intersector cooperation and the making of the Forestry Division a semi-autonomous institution so as to motivate and equip it to perform its functions more efficiently.
INTRODUCTION.
Objectives The main objectives of this study are as follows: To forecast the demand for forest products and services in the next two decades. · To plan and execute supply of these products and services during the same period. · To determine all the possible sources of impacts and influences on the demand and supply trends of those products and services during the period.
Background information.
Mandate of the Forestry Sub-Sector The mandate of the Forestry sector entails the provision of forest products and services to present and future generations of this country in perpetuity. This is achieved through forest regeneration; protection; management; public sensitisation and awareness raising on topical conservation issues, in collaboration with allied institutions, NGOs, local communities and youth groups etc.
Structure of the sector The Forestry sector of the present Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Marine Resources comprises of the large Forestry Conservation Section, a small Wildlife Conservation Unit and a Rubber Development Branch which production wing was privatised in 1994. Other sectors of the present Ministry are: Agriculture, Livestock, Planning Monitoring and Evaluation, Land and Water Development and Agricultural Engineering. The Environmental Protection Sector which mandate is closely allied to Forestry was lost to the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Country Planning early this year but it might move again.
Staff Disposition A total area of 507,700 ha comprising national forests, community forests, and wildlife protection areas is manned by followingly: 177 Forestry staff (90% in the Junior cadre) and 33 Wildlife staff (98% in the Junior cadre). The current protected area to staff ratio of 2418:1 is probably the most outrageous in the African region. At the moment, about 28 senior staff vacancies and 63 middle to Junior staff vacancies are to be filled (ref Annex 1-1). Established in 1911, the challenges of the past 9 decades have not been adequately addressed by the present low staff strength and capacity.
The Forest Estate Estimates of forest types by area contained in Annex 1.2 indicates that 60% of the nation's forest land area is occupied by forest regrowth. Unfortunately, this forest type.
continues to expand rapidly at the expense of the closed high forests in particular, due to agricultural expansion, logging, mining and other life-sustaining activities. Forests and other protected areas under government control presently occupy about 510% of the land area of Sierra Leone (see map 1.1). Attempts to expand areas under government control are frustrated by the fact that even the enlightened and resource-poor citizens very heavily depend on their land as the only means of livelihood and are least willing to dispose of it. The most frustrating aspect of the problem is that encroachment pressure on even the meagre forest estates under government control is on the increase . The post war situation could be worst considering the degree of lawlessness experienced behind rebel lines and the associated poverty and forest depletion imposed by the war. In addition, about 18,000ha of rubber Hevea brasielensis had been planted mostly in the Eastern and South Eastern regions in the early 60's. About 53,000 acres (21,285ha) of matured rubber estate was leased to the Sierra Rubber Company in January 1991. Operations should have started almost immediately but for the civil conflict that erupted close to the project site in March 1991. Sierra Leone's closed forests form the easternmost extent of the Upper Guinea Forest Block extending from the Dahomey Gap to Guinea (see map 1.2). The largest of these, the Gola Forest complex has a high species biodiversity and endemism with endangered species such as the African elephant (Lexodanta africana), Leopard and about 9 endangered or threatened primate species. Cross border migration of elephants between Northern Sierra Leone and Southern Guinea and Eastern Sierra Leone and Western Liberia are issues of sub-regional importance which had been proposed for funding by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in December 1999 during the Workshop on Bushmeat Management.
Funding and logistical support The agriculture sector receives the Lion's share of the re-current national budget. The Forestry sector is marginalized and underfunded in a Ministry where the major focus is food production. In addition, government actually spends over 80% of the Ministerial budgets on staff remuneration with a staggering 20 % on the logistical support necessary for making the sectors operational. However, the forestry sector had benefited from an UNDP/FAO intervention through a sector review and capacity building project, although the return of a majority of the trainees coincided with the escalation of the war in Freetown. This resulted in some additional brain drain. One output of the Capacity Building Project, the Forestry Planning Unit, could not be operational due to the pre-mature termination of the no- cost extension of that project in 1988 to be blamed on the deteriorating security situation.
Potentials of the Sector Membership of international conservation organizations and conventions such as CITES, Ramsar Conventions, CBD, UNFCC, etc. continues to guarantee support to the country's forestry and wildlife sector. Previous studies aimed at the development of the sector including Philipson's report (1986); Forestry sector review (1990); Agric Sector Master Plan study (1994) and now the Forestry Outlook Study for Africa hold promise for the development of the sector.
The untapped potentials of the wildlife sub-sector in terms of tourist revenue; gate fees to protected areas; export of wildlife; game hunting and regulated bushmeat trade could be harnessed during the period under review.
THE CHANGE DRIVERS.
Most long terms forecasts like the FOSA, utilise past consumption data to determine the secular trends in consumption through the use of appropriate biometric methods to determine future trends "cteris paribus" (all thing being equal). The "cteris paribus" clause hardly holds even during peace time let alone in projecting demand for products in wartorn Sierra Leone. While the normal change drivers or demand shifters apply in the Sierra Leone situation, the severity of the impacts of these factors may have been exacerbated by a decade of civil conflict. The country's population estimated at 4.3 million (1990) is believed to have increased at about 2.5% per annum (projected to 8.9 million in 2020) but a near-complete collapse of local government structures and the destabilization of about 60% of the population makes returnee population more crucial in the forecasting and supply exercise. Rural-urban migration and the seeking of refuge in neighbouring countries, poses entirely new questions i.e. How many refugees or IDPs will chose to make their host towns or countries a permanent abode? Specifically, the following factors are most likely to affect the forecast and the balancing of the demand and supply equation: · Housing and other needs of IDPs and refugees (including 149 office and residential complexes for returnee Paramount Chiefs). · Population dynamics over the past decades. · Rural ­urban migration. · Income distribution and changes in per capita income. · Social indicators as they interpret the use of national resources. · The role of tradition in conservation. · Cross border trade and migration within the Mano River Union. · Economic performance. · Institutional strengthening. · Impact of industrial development.
Housing and other needs for IDPs and Refugees. Annex 2.1 which presents the IDPs by present location and Chiefdom of origin clearly highlights the rehabilitation needs of the returnees in terms of housing, timber, fence sticks, firewood etc but it also highlights the need for the reforestation of areas in close proximity to the current camps which are being heavily depleted. In addition, the normal annual increases in housing units due to normal population increases should be accounted for, in terms of demand for construction material. Under the DFID good governance programme.
149 office/ residential complexes will be built for returnee Paramount Chiefs. A reforestation programme involving all the 149 chiefdoms is being planned.
Population Dynamics Important aspects of the country's population worthy of note are:.
% youth population looking for jobs now. Population of children born in 2000 who will be available for jobs and require housing by 2020. % aging and aged. % immigration and migration. number of ex-combatants to be gainfully employed.
Rural ­ Urban Migration This factor, if accurately determined could guide re-afforestation programmes to cater for highly populated areas; adjust for the expansion of settlements in urban and peri-urban areas; plantation establishment drives etc. The severity of the migration provides an indicator for rural development planning to contain the situation to some extent (see annex 2.3). Where urban population growth outweighs the expansion or increase in facilities to cope with the excess population, health-related and other social problems could surface.
Changes in per capita income and income distribution. As another measure of poverty, changes in per capita income which has been decreasing over the past 2 decades will affect the degree of utilization of natural resources. Examples of the negative impacts of the deterioration of per capita income and skewed income distribution include: · More people switching over to the use of firewood due to problems of affordability of modern stoves and also the increases in prices of petroleum products (see annex 2.4). · High prices of inorganic (chemical) fertilizers could discourage the application of the correct doses (or outright rejection) of fertilizers. This situation could encourage the cultivation of larger acreage of the "upland" to account for the differential in rice "yield" due to partial or non- application of fertilizers. Pressure on forests for wood energy will be exacerbated by increases in the pump price of kerosene which is the domestic fuel used by the majority of the population.
Social indicators as they interpret the use of natural resources. Factors such as the proportion of rural to urban based population; population distribution by standard age classes; urbanization and immigration trends; life expectancy; employment trends; proportion of literate population and literacy trends etc. tend to explain the heavy reliance on forests by particularly the rural poor.
The role of tradition and culture in shifting demand. Food avoidances and the avoidance of certain firewood species on the basis of superstition, culture etc could influence the choice of species in woodlot establishment (see annex 2.5). The maintenance of sacred groves that promote conservation could have a negative impact if such groves are targeted for large scale reforestation programmes. Special diets may encourage over-consumption of fire wood e.g. the cooking of dried broad beans utilises large quantities of firewood.
Cross border trade within the Mano River Union. Apart from exports from main national ports, illegal cross border trade in forest products could be substantial especially by boat on the Freetown ­ Conakry and Freetown ­ Monrovia routes. Since the land routes are only continually open and mostly insecure, this illegal trade in particularly timber and charcoal can not be ignored. Hence the need to make some estimated provision for it. Cross border migration of large mammals particularly of elephants could also affect the forecasts.
Economic Performance The balance of trade deficit is a realistic measure of the performance of the economy as a positive balance could ensure the provision of support to sectors such as forestry. For instance the visible trade balance for the period 1993/94 was USD 34 billion. Post war situation could be worst but recovery is anticipated with the diamond origin certification mechanism now put in place. Rutile accounted for 53% of the countries export earnings in 1993/94 followed by diamonds (32%); bauxite (7%); illmenite (5%) etc. With the cessation of hostilities in the main cocoa and coffee growing areas, more export earnings will be realised for the development of the natural resources. Air and sea vessels will increase in numbers thereby increasing revenue generation through landing fees, portage etc. The on-going but gradual appreciation of the "Leone" against the dollar could improve the performance of the economy. Aspects of the economy that could negatively impact on the use of natural resources are that of Economic and Trade liberalization. These factors will affect the following areas in particular: · the unregulated importation of powersaws · illegal exportation of sawn timber · unregulated registration of timber stores · duty waiver on sawmilling equipment · company registration laws not fool-proof Currently, there is a ban on log export on the grounds of local employment creation in remote areas by sawmillers.
Institutional Strengthening Recent changes in NGO/Government policy geared towards enhancing the efficiency of those institutions could result in positive impacts on natural resource management in the right geographical regions.
Avoiding duplication of efforts and ensuring coordination of efforts by all stakeholder ministries could be an added advantage. Village Forestry Associations, fully supported by the Forestry Act 1988, should be encouraged under the broad community forestry development agenda which the sector is currently rigorously pursuing. Only indirect control of communal lands, outside forest estates, could increase the area of managed forest estates since the acquisition of new lands is becoming increasingly difficult. The resuscitation of the District councils will discourage the present centralised financial management system, allowing the Districts and chiefdoms to participate in natural resources management more effectively. The reforestation programme sponsored by DFID could be commendable if effectively implemented. The Native Administration forests which support waned over the last decade will once more be supported by local chiefdom authorities. The present structure of the National Association of Farmers of Sierra Leone makes it a strong vehicle for the dissemination of ideas on tree planting and conservation messages to the grassroots level. Education of its membership through appropriate means for collaboration with this body could ensure: · the protection of some valuable timber species during the post war rehabilitation of cocoa, coffee and oil palm plantations · Protection of timber trees in cash crop establishment and maintenance · Catchment protection during slash and burn farming practices · Swamp development to reduce the pressure for farm land on the "uplands". · Agroforestry practices to be adopted in order to make the farmer more sedentary. The Institute of Agricultural Research and the Rice Research Station, Rokupr both have packages worthy of field trials nationwide. Making the small farmer sedentary could reduce the impact of the shifting cultivation practices on the vulnerable "uplands". 2.10. Impact of Industrial Development.
Once the demand for products and services is precisely determined, there will be need to balance the demand and supply through the assessment of what is available in terms of volume of timber etc. and how much needs to be planted. In order to avoid clash of interests or even the possible destruction of young trees due to the need for road construction, mining and other activities, road construction and mining plans and plans for other allied institutions will be used to guide the re-afforestation programmes (see map 2.1 and 2.2). Potential tourist attractions will continue to be conserved and the means of enhancing tourist turnover accelerated (see appendix 2.6). City and town planning departments will be encouraged to present expansion proposals for those settlements. Such proposals could also guide the forecast of timber and other construction ­ related needs. The quantum of forest vegetation in terms of area cleared and the volume of timber to be destroyed in road construction need to be estimated for planning purposes. The availability of labour for agriculture (including forestry) will be investigated despite the usual tendency of a mass exodus of labour to the minefields.
The possibility of establishing of a sustainable and reputable forest industry is being pursued in light of the fact that no logging and sawmilling company is operating in the country at the moment. The floating of indigenous logging and sawmilling companies will be encouraged to maximise return to local communities as financial incentives for forest reservation and in the interest of sustainability. Community heads will be encouraged to buy shares in these companies as a guarantee of their full support. The impact of agricultural expansion and particularly the agricultural practices presently in place; holds potentials for improvement particularly the inculcation of more environmentally- friendly farming methods such as agroforestry practices and the use of other ecologies. The protection of valuable timber species during cash crop rehabilitation will be emphasised. Out of a total area of 5,362,000 ha of arable land the uplands constitute 78.4 %; inland valley swamps (12.9%); mangrove swamps (3.7%); Bolilands (2.6%) and Riverine Grass lands (2.4%). Thus the cultivation of inland valley swamps; bolis and riverine grassland could reduce farming pressure on the upland. Timber and bush pole requirement for the construction of 300,000 housing units nationwide will be determined and the supply mechanism instituted in collaboration with the Housing Division of the Ministry of Lands, Housing, Country Planning and the Environment. Construction wood needs for the 149 housing units for the 149 Paramount Chiefs will be calculated. 2.11. Response to questionnaires.
Change drivers will definitely have an impact on deforestation, conservation and rehabilitation programmes as exemplified by 46 respondents to questionnaires administered. (see annex 2.7) While 75% of respondents agreed that population growth will fuel deforestation, about 45% feel that rural-urban migration will have same impact. Decrease in per capita income was blamed by 45% while only 33% blamed poor income distribution for fuelling deforestation. Increases in poverty levels, wood energy prices and the price of rice were blamed for increased deforestation by 69%, 54% and 36% respectively, while support for resettlement and the return of returnees is blamed for deforestation by 31% and 37% respectively. Other possible future civil conflicts and the proliferation of NGOs were only blamed by 23% and 33% of respondents respectively. On the impact of local government capacity on enhancing forest resource management, 47% was attributed to the reconstitution of District Councils; 50% to decentralization and 38% to the return of Paramount Chiefs to their respective chiefdoms. Proper coordination of NGO activities; the constitution of a national seed board and the establishment of a national forest tree seed programme will enhance management by 38%; 28%; and 45% respectively. Agricultural expansion is one of the biggest culprits of deforestation. This was exemplified by 28% of the respondents blaming it on tractorization; 36% on food production campaigns; 33% on farmer empowerment and 33% on the introduction of the Unified Agricultural.
Extension System. Unsubsidised fertilizer prices may create problem of affordability by most resource ­ poor farmers. Hence 29% of respondents expected that policy measure to fuel deforestation as larger parcels of land could be cultivated to make good the deficit in yield, due to the non-application of yield- increasing fertilizers. The cultivation of alternative ecologies such as inland valley swamps and mangrove swamps which cultivation could decelerate deforestation of dry land forests by 28% and 21% respectively. Alternative energy sources could reduce the spate of deforestation mostly for obtaining biomass energy. Understandably, 50% of respondents supported the idea while 33% felt that increased demand for raw materials could fuel forestry development while another 50% felt that the additional shift of labour to industries could fuel development of the forestry sector. The role of unemployment in fuelling deforestation was exemplified by the fact that 50% of respondents felt that industries to be developed in the next 2 decades can only absorb modestly, the additional labour produced by normal population increases. Only 38% felt that NGOs could adequately absorb some of the excess labour. However 50% felt that the positive impact of tourism on the economy in the next 2 decades will be substantial. Alternative energy sources are often expected to reduce pressure on forests for biomass energy but only 28% blamed fuel price increases for deforestation while 40% blamed increases in the cost of cooking appliances. However 41% felt that the provision of cheap hydro electric power, following the completion of the Bumbuna project, will positively influence the use of electric cookers thereby reducing the dependence on biomass slightly. Forty percent expected the adoption of wood burning stoves to be high. However, 40% of respondents felt that the chances of harnessing other HEP sources are very low meaning that this alternative may not substantially contribute to curbing deforestation effectively. As for the negative impact of road construction on forests, only 28% felt that it will be high in the next 2 decades, while 40% felt that development in communication sector will enhance forestry development. Trade Liberalization affects forest harvesting and sale of products. Therefore 85%, 66% and 47% felt that the uncontrolled importation of powersaws; illegal exportation of forest products and the uncontrolled opening of timber stores fuel deforestation respectively. In addition, poor interdepartmental collaboration and the illegal importation of powersaws were blamed by only 36% and 33% respectively. Policy changes in the sector could enhance forestry development. While 78% felt support for community forestry could enhance forestry development, only 52% and 57% felt that the national tree planting drive and enhanced public awareness could do the same. Fifty eight percent felt that technical training for NGOs in environmental conservation will enhance forestry development but surprisingly only 28% felt that education of powersaw operators, pit sawyers and charcoal burners will enhance forestry development. Contracting out seedling production and plantation establishment to local communities was supported by 50% of respondents, while 50% felt increased political will could enhance forestry development and 31% supported the sale of forest tree seedlings which are currently distributed free.
Technological changes in forestry and allied fields could enhance forestry development provided they increase wood recovery, enhance seedling production and build the capacities of stakeholder organizations. While 40% of respondents felt that modernised sawmills would enhance forestry development, only 33% saw the advantage of "tubed" seedlings over naked ones in enhancing nursery productivity. In fact 38% actually advocated the direct broadcast of seeds on taungya farms. This method when successful, could reduce labour cost on land clearing and tree planting. Support to and sensitisation of stakeholders (farmers/youths etc.) was advocated by 45% of respondents while the provision of tree felling and extraction equipment to facilitate firewood sales was not favourably supported by 60%. However the introduction of energyefficiency charcoal kilns received 42% support. Investment in the forestry sector did not receive a high rating. Respondents felt that the chances of investment are likely to be medium. Forty percent considered high investment in forest exploitation; 45% expect medium to average investment potential in re-afforestation activities; 31% expected medium to average investment in national parks and wildlife management and 35% expected average investment in eco-tourism. Also, 31% expected moderate investment in rubber exploitation; 26% in rubber plantation establishment and 33% in the establishment of zoos. Potentials for donor intervention over the next 20 years was rated as 38% by the respondents. Forty percent of respondents felt that the negative impact of land tenure is high while the impact of livestock restocking is rated as moderate. The limited adoption of agroforestry methods is expected to have negative impact. Increased globalisation trends could have a negative impact on forestry development due to increase in deforestation pressure.
FORESTRY SECTOR IN 2020.
State of Forests and Plantations.
Deforestation Pressure During the next 2 decades, the area of legally constituted forest estates will continue to decrease due to urban and agricultural expansion which will permanently change the landuse. In cases such as encroachments for mining, the forest land could be replanted at the end of the mining operation. About10% of the country's land area (both government controlled estates and salvage areas) comprising of closed forests would have been deforested at the rate of about 1.5% - 2.0% per annum thereby increasing the area under forest regrowth currently occupying 60% of the country's total land area.
3.1.2. Fate of Community Forests Chiefdom Authorities would have succeeded in re-claiming most of the communal forests currently under government control mostly for agricultural expansion; the expansion of rural settlements; the establishment of new settlements etc. Road construction, particularly logging roads would have "opened up " hitherto remote and inaccessible areas to further fuel encroachment on the estates and wildlife exploitation. Natural regeneration of logged out forests will be adversely affected by the activities of shifting cultivators who would normally find it difficult to cultivate primary forests comprising of giant trees using rudimentary farming tools and the type of logging and extraction methods instituted.
Plantation Establishment Replacement of natural forests with plantations of fast growing (relatively low quality timber) species will be the rule, on economic grounds, and probably due to the limited knowledge on the silviculture of the indigenous high value timber species. Funding possibilities permitting, plantations will expand at the expense of natural forests. Most of the mahoganies would have been seriously depleted except in strict Nature Reserves, provided these could be effectively protected. Plantations established in the 60s to 80´s would have been harvested or naturally depleted and replaced to some extent. A few instances of Gmelina arborea and Terminalia ivorensis "die back;" currently experienced nation-wide, could have reduced the quality of the forest crop in the affected plantations. Due to the lack of maintenance, most of the forest crop in plantations will produce low value sawn timber. However, for plantations close to urban or highly populated mining areas, most of the unutilised wood could be converted to charcoal or sold as firewood. Wildfire damage to both natural forests and plantations particularly in the drier northern and central districts is likely to increase due to the expanse of savannah lands.
3.1.4. Past Tree Planting Efforts Since the inception of the national tree planting drive in 1985, tree establishment outside forest estates, either in towns or on small plots, continue to increase, albeit slowly. Some trees established in or around settlements had been destroyed by wild fires, vandalism, grazing pressure etc. However these trees or woodlots comprising mostly of Acacia mangium, A. auriculiformis, Gmelina arborea etc. would contribute significantly to firewood needs particularly in the drier northern and north central districts. Between 1985 and 1995 the UNDP/FAO Fuelwood Project and PLAN International supported farmers to establish 1,000 ha and 400 ha of mostly Acacia mangium and A. curiculiformis in the Western Area of the country. Also, over the same period, the Rokel Leaf Tobacco Development Company supported contact farmers to establish a total of 800 ha in the northern province.
In addition, other agricultural projects with forestry components could have established another 400 ha nationwide. Some of these plantations would have been replaced at least once by year 2020.
Tourism and Biodervisity Development By 2020, non wood forest products will be playing significant roles in terms of employment, tourism and rural development. Rattan furniture production which started in the mid 90s would have grown to a reputable industry with costs slightly above that of timber furniture which only targets the local market, at least for now. In addition, raphia palm cane is widely used as furniture, doors, beds etc. in rural Sierra Leone. The sale of rattan household utensils along the highways to the East and South has become significant over the past decade and is likely to become lucrative, provided the producers get value for money rather than the middle man taking the lion's share of the profits. During the next 2 decades, these sources of material would significantly supplement timber and contribute to timber conservation provided the source of the rattan cane is conserved and ideal replenishment methods instituted. Honey production for the market has started gaining grounds and holds much potential for the future. A soft drink manufacturing company ­ the Freetown Cold Storage, had already put honey on its shelves by 1992. A honey production association has been formed and a few expatriates have manifested interest in commercial honey production. Beeswax production also hold lots of potential for rural development. Potential tourist hotspots have been identified by the Natural Tourist Board which is also working closely with the Forestry sector to develop projects to enhance tourism and rural development. Tourist attractions such as the Africana Tokeh village, St. Michaels Lodge, Lakka Beach Hotel etc. which thrived well before the escalation of hostilities are likely to have developed effectively by 2020. Biodiversity conservation would be more effective in the 8 important bird areas (IBAs) established in 1996. (See annex 3.1). With the continuous support of the Global Environmental Facility- funded "African NGO-Government partnership for biodiversity conservation project", launched in April 99 to run till 2004, these IBAs would have been managed more effectively. The Outamba Kilimi National Park, (Sierra Leone's First National Park) would have been fully supported with funds from the EU and other donors. Other proposed national parks, strict nature reserves, game sanctuaries etc. would have been fully developed. Tiwai Island would have fully developed to benefit the communities in terms of gate takings, cooperative store, interpretation fees, tour guide fees etc. Eco-tourism development will depend mostly on the extent of rehabilitation of the roads following the cessation of hostilities and the conservation of biodiversity.
State of Forest Industries Most forest industries, (logging and sawmilling companies) had been affected by political interference, nepotism, dominance of foreign investors and poor transparency and accountability. Logging, sawmilling and furniture production industries with high number of indigenous shareholders are likely to be encouraged in the interest of sustainability. In the absence of an operational forest industry for the past 4 ­ 5 years, individual powersaw operators, which continue to increase in numbers, have been encouraged to float an indigenous company to ensure the effective realization of benefits by local forest-based communities and ensure reforestation. Sawn timber of standard dimensions, possibly plywood and even pulp production would be possible by 2020. Acacia and Gmelina plantations established now could provide pulpable materials. Due to difficult working terrains in most of the forests and the relatively high cost of forest road construction in poorly drained areas, mobile sawmills are likely to dominate sawmilling operations. Industries using near-obsolete machinery will have to change to modern machinery in order to stay in profitable business. Export of high-value sawn timber could resume, following its termination in 1990. Pressure will continue to mount on the Forestry Sector for the resumption of round-wood export during the next 2 decades and the sector may allow some limited log export. Many entrepreneurs would have ventured to import machinery before seeking professional advice. The training of sawmill technicians, saw doctors, saw operators etc will be a necessary pre-requisite to the success of sawmills in future. Illegal exportation of sawn timber to Liberia and Guinea by boat will continue as long as illgotton timber, with minimal production cost, is available and particularly due to the high price differential between sawn timber prices of Sierra Leone and the neighbouring countries. However the sustainability of raw material supply is critical to the future success of the industry. The rattan cane industry will thrive and possibly reduce the pressure on timber for furniture production. The carving industry will open up at a rate probably in proportion to tourism development. Wood waste could be utilised for this purpose to the advantage of the sector.
Wood Supply Situation. Based on a projected population estimate of 8.9 million in year 2020 and on the basis of per capita consumption of sawn timber, construction poles, firewood and charcoal of 0.07 m3, 0.012 m3, 0.52 m3 and 0.11 m3 respectively. The wood supply and demand situation will probably reflect a deficit. The total standing volume of timber in all types of forests is 6.6 million m3 (1990) and the annual increment of the various forest types will result in a yearly volume increase of 495,000 m3 for all exploitable forests over the 20-year period. The scale of deforestation is not known with any certainty particularly over the past 9 years. White wood supply to remote areas will be relatively easy, cheap and less time-consuming due to close proximity.
to raw materials. However, supply to urban areas will be difficult, expensive and timeconsuming especially considering the poor state of our provincial routes.
Timber, Poles and Fuelwood Supply Industrial roundwood will be mostly produced in the east and south of the country about 200 miles from the capital, Freetown. Construction poles mostly comprising of Anisophylea laurina are currently utilised in the construction of Internally Displaced Person's and Refugee camps. The present stocks are not managed on any sustainable basis as the current rate of depletion by far exceeds the rate of replenishment. Contracting construction pole (fence sticks) supply directly to local communities encourages the depletion of even the heavily depleted Western Area Peninsula forests which are managed purely for protection purposes and frustrates the efforts of the forestry personnel to discourage such a lucrative business. The NGOs mostly pay twice the normal market price for these poles. A replenishment programme will be ideal and NGOs in shelter construction should be ideally supportive. Woodlots established by farming communities in the Western Area will supply the Freetown population but the extra large sizes of billets, making splitting and handling difficult, could make it less attractive than the small 30 ­ 40 mm diameter billets, obtained from forest regrowth. Charcoal production methods currently used encourage a lot of wastage. Proper charcoal production kilms will be introduced in order to make the production method energy-efficient.
Alternative Energy Sources Peat deposits are found in the Ribbi chiefdom and probably in other areas. Peat is a potential source of energy and its contribution to biomass energy could be explored fully. Coconut shell for fish smoking particularly in the fishing communities of Shenge where coconuts are also grown in abundance could provide alternative biomass energy source. Energy generation from Sewage holds a lot of potential as exemplified by the Bomeh methane generation project of the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Tidal, wind and solar energy are grossly underutilised at the moment. However solar energy tapping through solar panels seems to be on the increase and is likely to be explored intensively in the next 2 decades. Dependence on imported petroleum is risky because frequent price increases tend to force users of kerosene, electricity and gas stove users to resort to the use of firewood and or charcoal. Fuel price increases over the past decade average about 27% per year although the price of kerosene which is used by 95% of the population has remained constant for the last two price increases in year 2000. Also increases in fuel price in March 97, June 98 and 99 left kerosene at Le 2,000 (see annex 2.4). In addition increases in the prices of cooking stoves themselves could force consumers to resort to either cheap mud stoves or even the zero cost 3-stones cooking method.The completion of the 305MW Bumbuna Hydro Electric Project by 2003 ­ 2004 could ensure the generation of relatively cheap electricity. This may reduce the number of consumers reverting to the use of biomass energy on price conditionalities alone.
Also, the 5MW Goma Hydro Electric Project provides cheap and reliable electricity to the Eastern and Southern Provincial headquarters of Kenema and Bo respectively. However, during the dries, when the water levels and power drop, heavy fuel oil is used to generate power; hence the partial (seasonal) dependence. Generally, the dependence on imported petroleum products will continue to be heavy in the industrial sector. At the moment, petroleum-powered-electricity generated accounts for only 27% of the total electric energy needs of the capital Freetown. Plywood, particle board, hardboard etc. are currently imported into the country for building construction, maintenance etc. In the absence of a functional and reputable timber company, the importation of these commodities will continue, unabated. Apart from packaging wood, timber import is not a normal practice. However, cheap packaging wood, provides construction material for the less well to do in society. Match splint was imported up to 1994/95 when the company closed. The company may resume normal operations following the cessation of hostilities. Furniture importation by returning students, diplomats etc. continues but could be insignificant in terms of volume and cost.
Social and economic contribution of Forestry. Sierra Leone has about 24 HEP sites capable of generating electricity. But of those, only the 5 MW Goma supplies hydro power to the provincial capitals of the East and South respectively When completed, the 305 MW, H.E.P. will produce surplus energy for exportation to neighbouring countries with substantial foreign exchange earnings. In addition, the Guma Valley Water Company and the Intrapex Water Company spend about Le 70 million and Le 10 million on staff and labour welfare per month respectively. The now defunct Forest Industries Corporation; Panguma sawmills; Sierra Wood Ltd; and the Sierra Leone Timber and Plantation Company (SILETI), employed over 4,000 workers (skilled and unskilled) and constructed and maintained over 600 miles of road in rural settings in Eastern Sierra Leone during 80´s and 90´s. About 80% of the population is rural based consuming 6.2 million m3 of firewood; 396,000 m3 wood equivalent of charcoal; 43,200 m3 of fence sticks and 252,000 m3 of timber for construction, cooking, heating etc per year. The crucial role of forests in food security in Sierra Leone lies in the fact that most of the socalled hungry season foods are available and affordable mostly during the rains, when roads are impassable, thereby cutting off imported food supply from the urban centres.
In addition, rural children obtain most of their vitamin C supplies from the plum of Spondias mombin, Anisophyllea laurina, Cola lateritia and Parinari excelsa. Also, a common source of protein during the dry season, is from the roasted seeds of Pentaclethra macrophylla and Bussea accidentalis. In Western Sierra Leone, for instance, over 70 plants species have been identified for plant medicine and dyes in the Western Area peninsula forests alone. The cabbage of the young palm tree, bush yams (Discorea) etc are important hungry season foods in rural Sierra Leone. The forestry sector provides employment for joinery and carpentry shops; pole, and firewood sales, sale of snack foods, medicinal herbs, rattan cane furniture production and sale etc. The construction of extraction roads, trunk roads and their maintenance "opens up" areas which were hitherto closed to development. Such rural roads enhance agricultural development; ensure the delivery of health services to remote communities and improve the economy of rural communities due to the influx of employees of logging and sawmilling companies. In addition, forests and related industries employ at rural level substantially thereby curbing rural/urban migration.
Forestry and the Environment.
Conservation and Biodiversity. Most biodiversity hotspots in Sierra Leone are contained in the following protected areas: forest reserves; community forests, national parks; game sanctuaries and other proposed protection areas. In addition, certain protected areas have been designated as important bird areas (IBAs) which protection and conservation is covered by the Global Environmental Facility-funded, "African-NGO partnership for sustainable biodiversity conservation project" (see annex 3.1). In addition, the 741 km2 Gola Forest complex had been managed under the support of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) since May 1990. The adjacent 12 Km2 Tiwai island which forms a buffer zone to Gola West had been supported by the New York Zoology Society; the City University of New York and the Miami University, since the early 80´s. Forest biodiversty could be better conserved depending on the cooperation of the local forest-dependent communities; funding support for monitoring; community sensitisation; controlled harvesting and the much needed political will. In addition, forest patches and sacred groves on communal lands, if protected in collaboration with the communities, could ensure biodiversity conservation. Secret society bushes which were well protected before the onset of the rebel war, could now host some substantial plant and animal biodiversity due to the reduced deforestation around abandoned settlements.
3.5.2. Protective Role of Forests Sierra Leone's 24 potential HEP sites currently benefit from forest cover but even these high altitude vegetations are threatened by shifting cultivation and wild fires. However, a management plan has been proposed for the 305 MW Bumbuna catchment while the 5MW output Goma HEP is currently being protected. In addition, the Sugar Loaf catchment of the Freetown Waterworks Forests Reserve, is fairly well protected and supplies water to the Guma, Babadori and Congo dams which supply Freetown, the nations capital. Most catchments are fully or part of forest estates. The Guma Valley Water Company proposed World Bank-funded "water yield enhancement project" should include forest protection and regeneration efforts if the water yield should cope with the expanding population. The cooperation of Guma management is crucial to the catchment protection aspect of the project. The Catholic Relief Services sponsored project "Restoring the Lion Mountains" if sustained, could restore forest vegetation on the vulnerable hilltops overhanging Freetown. Similar interactions should be replicated along the Wara Wara mountains of Kabala and the Wusum Hills of Makeni, (both in the North); Moyamba Hills (Moyamba Forest Reserve) in the south; the Kambui Hills in the East etc.
Plantation establishment and tree planting Carbon sequestration could be significant from plantation forests which may be better managed than natural forests which are currently seriously threatened by powersaw operations; agricultural expansion; mining etc. Tree planting by communities in particular and the retention of forest vegetation at critical sites could decelerate land degradation and slow down desertification. In the absence of substantial interventions and effective collaboration, the forest cover, in the next two decades will be by far less than the present cover, resulting in an accelerated soil degradation.
Institutional Framework.
Structure and Function of Forestry Division Forestry Division comprises of Forest Conservation, Wildlife Conservation and Rubber Development Branch (now privatised). Functional Units comprise of Forest Research, Tree Diseases, Training ­all fully functional up to 1985 but now virtually defunct due to poor funding and the lack of staff. Regional Forest Officers (RFOs) implement government forest policy at regional level. They are assisted by ARFO, Foresters, Supervisors, Rangers, Forest Guards and Work Service Employees. The mandate of the Division entails the provision of forests products and services thereto for present and future generations in perpetuity. This is achieved through forest reservation, forest protection, seedling production, tree planting and maintenance, regulation of harvests, public education and sensitisation on deforestation, reforestation, energy and soil conservation etc. The Wildlife Conservation Branch is grossly understaffed and the present core of staff need basic training in Forest and Wildlife Management to be effective.
3.6.2. New Roles for the Private Sector and Local Communities The private sector should be seen to be more functional in the following areas: · Investment in non-wood forest products such as rattan and bamboo furniture and household utensils production, honey production, rubber establishment and processing etc. · Communities to be involved in the management of forests outside government controlled forest estates; communities to take up seedling production and tree planting contracts after successful training programmes. They should fully participate in fire prevention and fire fighting (fire management) wildlife conservation, management of wetlands etc. · Production of transmission poles from the overgrown 70 ha Bradford pine plantation. This holds immense investment potential for rural electrification. · Carving industry to be developed to support the tourist industry utilizing logging and sawmill waste. · Revamp the forest production and utilization unit to facilitate revenue generation and the utilization of forest blocks not readily accepted by concessionaires.
