	Abstract = {We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning.   Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent an approximate posterior distribution and uses this for optimisation of a variational lower bound.  We develop stochastic backpropagation -- rules for gradient backpropagation through stochastic variables -- and   derive an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition models.  We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that by using stochastic backpropagation and variational inference, we obtain models that are able to  generate realistic samples of data, allow for accurate imputations of missing data, and provide a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.},

	Abstract = {How can a machine learn from experience? Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework, which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in the field, namely, probabilistic programming, Bayesian optimization, data compression and automatic model discovery.},
