DESCRIPTION: Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) model proposed by Ribba et al
A tumor growth inhibition model for low-grade glioma treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Clinical Cancer Research, 18(18), 5071-5080, 2012.

Variables 
- PT: proliferative equiescent tissue
- QT: nonproliferative equiescent tissue
- QP: damaged quiescent cells 
- C:  concentration of a virtual drug encompassing the 3 chemotherapeutic components of the PCV regimen

Parameters
- K      : maximal tumor size (should be fixed a priori)
- KDE    : the rate constant for the decay of the PCV concentration in plasma
- kPQ    : the rate constant for transition from proliferation to quiescence
- kQpP   : the rate constant for transfer from damaged quiescent tissue to proliferative tissue 
- lambdaP: the rate constant of growth for the proliferative tissue
- gamma  : the rate of damages in proliferative and quiescent tissue
- deltaQP: the rate constant for elimination of the damaged quiescent tissue
- PT0    : initial proliferative equiescent tissue
- QT0    : initial nonproliferative equiescent tissue
